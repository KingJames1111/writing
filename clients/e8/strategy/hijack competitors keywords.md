 
Hijack the “Topstep” Search & Win the Category
Problem → high intent navigational queries (Topstep, FTMO, etc.) leak your best buyers.
Promise → we intercept those searches with curiosity driven, comparison content, localize where rivals are strongest, and convert “prop curious” traffic into Simulated Finance sign ups and payouts.
Executive Snapshot (what matters)
•	Where rivals are strong: Topstep is U.S.-heavy; FTMO is U.K./EU weighted; FundedNext leans U.S. + India + Africa.
•	Localization edge: FTMO runs ~20 support languages, FundedNext runs full multilingual Help Center (incl. PT BR, AR, TR, TH, ZH), Topstep shows Spanish/French/Chinese options on core pages. (FTMO Careers)
•	Our positioning to exploit: E8’s payout trust (<10h avg), platform diversity, and SimFi language convert comparison clicks at the moment of doubt.

What each rival is doing to win local market share (and how we counter)
Topstep (Futures first, US led)
•	US dominant footprint with meaningful Canada/UK pockets.
•	Language toggles (Español/Français/中文) & localized currency via Localize on product flows—light but smart i18n to reduce friction. (Tradeify)
Counter: build a Futures pillar that reframes platform lock in & “consistency rules” into SimFi’s EOD breathing room vs Trailing momentum narrative + payout proof objects.
FTMO (Czech HQ; EU scale, deep localization)
•	20 support languages; UK, DE, BR, VN, FR lead; large multi market editorial library (academy, MQL series) that feeds links. (FTMO Careers)
Counter: beat FTMO at navigational interception in EN/DE/FR/PT BR: “Before You Deposit at FTMO: the SimFi safety check (EOD vs Trailing)” + programmatic /compare/ftmo-vs e8 variations.
FundedNext (global affiliate engine; Africa/India penetration)
•	Multilingual Help Center & PT BR site, Lingpad powered support workflow; US + India are top traffic drivers; visible regional social (“FundedNext Asia”) suggesting localized comms. (FundedNext)
Counter: ship /pt br and /hi high intent clusters first (platform compares, payout pages), then country specific affiliate kits (FTC/ASA safe) with PR grade link assets. 
MyFundedFutures (US futures challenger)
•	US skewed audience versus peer sites; content cadence around futures explainer/selection; restricted countries list limits international scale. (My Funded Futures)
Counter: “Topstep vs Tradeify vs MFF vs E8” futures comparison hub + rollover risk content that ranks fast and earns links.
Tradeify (fast rising U.S. futures)
•	~1.1M visits with U.S. focus (in US slice comparator vs Topstep).
Counter: dominate “Tradeify alternatives” & “Tradeify rules explained” in EN + PT BR with calculator widgets (dollars near %). 
Alpha Capital Group (U.K. cluster)
•	UK heavy audience; recruiting Spanish speaking ops; clear geographic restrictions (150+ allowed countries; sanctions list published). (Similarweb)
Counter: /uk SERM takeover pages (Alpha vs E8) + Spanish language UK/EU explainer to siphon bilingual searches.
SERM Playbook: win the “Topstep + E8” query (and every brand compare)
Primary asset:
H1: Before You Join Topstep, Read This: EOD vs Trailing, Payout Speed, and the “Consistency Rule” That Clips Traders
Angle: contrast rules with $ next to % and payout speed proof; embed a milestone calculator; drive to Configurator.
Outline (drop in modules):
1.	Curiosity opener (why navigational searches hide the real cost)
2.	SimFi vs Prop (category clarity; no live funding claims) 
3.	Rules that matter: EOD (closed balance) vs Trailing—10 second math + example 
4.	Payout rail proof: “<10 hours average” + USD/crypto rails (1$ wallet verification note) 
5.	“Consistency” traps: where evaluation frameworks cause failures; show what changes under SimFi
6.	Calculator widget: 2.5% on $100K = $2,500 (illustrative) + timeline to cashout 
7.	CTA: Compare Topstep vs E8 → Start Signature QuickStart 
SKU this pattern programmatically for FTMO vs E8, FundedNext vs E8, Tradeify vs E8, MFF vs E8 and for l10n: /pt br/, /de/, /fr/, /tr/. (Title/slug/meta templates in the SEO Playbook.) 
Internationalization Roadmap (where to localize first)
Pick markets where competitors already trained demand:
•	PT BR (Brazil) — FTMO’s top 5; FundedNext runs full PT BR help center. Ship /pt br/futuros & /pt br/comparar/ftmo-vs-e8 + PT affiliate kit. (FundedNext)
•	DE/UK — FTMO’s EU backbone; build /de/futures handel plattform & /uk/topstep alternatives.
•	IN — FundedNext hotspot; publish risk first Hindi FAQ + payouts page; partner kit for Indian creators.
•	TR — competitors present but under served; launch /tr/sanal finans explainer + brand compares. (TR proof points are thinner across rivals → fast wins.)
Execution details (E8 SOPs):
•	Modules every page must carry: risk model primer, milestone calculator ($ near %), payout rails UI, FAQPage JSON LD, breadcrumb schema. 
•	Affiliate/i18n kit: EN/ES/PT BR/DE/TR templates, FTC/ASA disclosure, Sift guarded links. 
“Julian Goldie” style Off Page Plan (white hat, relentless, compounding)
1) Link gap sniper (weekly)
Export the top 300 referring domains to each rival’s “compare/alternatives/review” URLs → pitch data rich resources:
•	“Futures Rollover Calendar (auto updated)” (tool PR bait).
•	“Payout Speed Study: SimFi vs Prop (methodology public; no guarantees).” 
2) Curiosity skyscrapers (monthly)
•	“The Two Loss Stop That Saves Weeks” (rules + calculator + SOP)
•	“Fees You Actually Feel — side by side in dollars” (link magnet for journalists). 
3) Journalist sourcing & partner PR
Use Qwoted/Connectively + regional finance blogs (PT BR/DE/ES/TR) to place expert quotes that link to our flagship pillars and brand on ramps. 
4) Comparison network & SERM
Systematically publish /compare/ pages and syndicate summaries to compliant affiliate sites (with UTMs from the publication checklist). 
90 Day Delivery Plan (sprint cadence)
Days 1–15 — “Minimum Viable Takeover”

•	KPI: 2 compare pages live; 40 referring domains in pipeline; indexing T+24h validation per checklist. 
Days 16–45 — “International lift”

What your slides should say (copy ready bullets)
Headline: “They chase deposits. We train payouts.”
•	E8 = Simulated Finance, not a prop firm—payout first system (USD/crypto rails; <10h avg).
•	We intercept brand searches (Topstep/FTMO/FundedNext) with curiosity compare pages, localized to PT BR/DE/UK/TR/IN.
•	Proof objects on page: risk model primer, calculator with $ next to %, payout timeline UI, FAQs with JSON LD. 
•	Link plan: journalist quotes + tool PR + comparison syndication; governed by FTC/ASA kit & UTMs. 
•	90 day KPIs: +100% new KWs, Top 10 for 3+ compares, measurable brand query hijack in PT BR/DE.

Risks & guardrails

•	Compliance language: maintain SimFi framing (no live funding claims; futures rollover note; payout rails disclosure).

3.	Turn on weekly link gap sprints (target list prepped).
4.	Confirm PT BR/DE translators (we can provide briefs/templates).
We’ll own the “Topstep” click—then the category.
