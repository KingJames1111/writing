 

KEEP THE HOOK. SET THE FRAME.
C Level Workroom Memo — Reframing “Zero Risk” while preserving our conversion engine


To: Dylan & George (cc: Brand, Growth, Product, CX, Data)
From: James— Messaging & Compliance Workroom
Date: September 17, 2025

Subject: Harmonizing our “Simulated Capital. Real Payouts. Zero Risk.” message with SiMFi positioning — without dulling the edge

Read first — business guidance, not legal advice. This memo reflects business strategy and compliance aware copycraft, not legal counsel. We are not your attorneys, and this is not legal advice. Our goal is to keep the performance psychology that’s working, align it to our education only model, and codify patterns your teams can scale across pages and campaigns.
1) Rapport & Reality check (Problem / Promise)
What’s great: The team’s scrutiny is a strength. It proves we’re building a blue chip, durable category (SiMFi: Simulated Finance Environment, Markets & Financial Instruction). The hero line on the current homepage has big idea energy that pulls conversion:
“Simulated Capital, Real Payouts, Zero Risk … Over $57 million already paid … no brokers, no deposits, and zero margin risk.” 
What’s real: In regulators’ eyes, “zero risk” is an absolute. If any material risk exists (fees, eligibility, discretionary acceptance), the headline must carry its limits right where the promise is perceived — not just in a footer or distant FAQ. That’s the FTC’s “clear & conspicuous” and “net impression” standard for digital ads, especially on mobile. (Federal Trade Commission)
The promise: We can keep the hook by narrowing the risk type we remove (live capital/margin) and by placing clean, brand voiced qualifiers close enough to the hero to defend the net impression — without wrecking cadence.
2) Internal anchors — how we describe the platform (use these everywhere)
Platform classification (use verbatim tone, align ESPA §1.1 / §1.3):
E8 is a SaaS educational simulation platform built for skills development, data collection, and analytical modeling. It is not a trading platform, financial instrument, investment contract, or security. Participation is for education, not for investment or speculation. All incentives are discretionary and contingent on E8’s acceptance and licensing of performance data. (Mirror this language in product pages, FAQs, and checkout.)
Why this matters: It places us under FTC advertising standards (truthful, substantiated, clear and conspicuous), rather than SEC/FINRA/CFTC product rules. We still borrow simulated performance disclaimers from CFTC/NFA as best practice whenever we visualize performance. (Federal Trade Commission)
3) Proximity that protects the net impression (and keeps rhythm)
What “proximity” means (practical): The qualifier must be near enough that a typical user sees, reads, and connects it to the triggering claim without hunting. Think same visual field, same interaction, and first screen on mobile. Putting it after a block of content or only in the footer usually fails the standard. (Federal Trade Commission)
Our “Proximity Ladder” (choose by risk tolerance; A is strongest):
•	A — Inline + same breath (safest)
Headline narrows the risk (“No live capital or margin risk”) and the first line beneath explains what they buy and discretionary payouts.
•	B — Hero box endcap (assertive but defensible)
Headline stays tight; a small italic block at the bottom of the hero container clarifies purchase/payout. Anchor symbol (†) in headline ties to the endcap. (Meets proximity; less visual interference.) (Federal Trade Commission)
•	C — Section end disclosure panel (higher risk)
Qualifier appears at the end of the first section, not the hero. Use anchor jump from the headline and ensure the panel is above the fold on mobile. (Use only if hero space is constrained.) (Federal Trade Commission)
Not recommended: Footer only, tooltip only, or anything below the first screen on mobile. Those placements routinely fail “clear & conspicuous.” (Federal Trade Commission)
4) Copycraft that rides the line — compliant and conversion forward
4.1 Hero line options (pick one)
Option A (safest; high clarity):
Simulated capital. Real training. No live capital or margin risk.
You’re purchasing access to an educational simulation and assessment. Payouts are discretionary—not guaranteed—and require E8’s acceptance & licensing of your performance data.
Option B (assertive; keeps “Zero” energy, narrows it):
Zero live capital risk. Real training. Real time markets.
All activity is simulated; fees are for education/simulation. Any payout is discretionary, subject to acceptance & data licensing.
Option C (headline stays hot; disclosure as hero endcap †)
Simulated capital. Real payouts. Zero live capital risk.†
† Educational simulation & assessment purchase; discretionary payouts contingent on E8’s acceptance & licensing of performance data.
Why these work: We name the risk category we remove (live capital/margin), tell users what they’re buying, and how payouts actually work—at the point of impression. That’s exactly what the FTC expects when absolutes could mislead. (Federal Trade Commission)
4.2 The $57M stat (badge copy patterns)
•	Badge (preferred): $57,0XX,XXX in discretionary incentives since [Start Date]. Method & period ➜
•	Microline (optional if space permits): Aggregated across E8 simulation programs; individual outcomes vary.
Pair the number with a date range (or make it a live feed) and a methods page describing what’s included. This follows the FTC’s substantiation + proximity posture seen in the Intuit order and recent H&R Block action around unqualified “free”—the principle carries: don’t let the headline out run the fine print. (Federal Trade Commission)
4.3 “Live payouts” stream — name it for what it is
Change “Live funded payouts — updated every 60 seconds” → “Live incentive disbursements — updated every 60 seconds.” Add a small data source note: Feed reflects discretionary incentive disbursements from the simulation program; amounts are not trading profits. 
4.4 Testimonials / results modules (tighten typicality)
If we keep quotes like “withdrew over $2,800 in under 9 days,” add a typicality or context line right there (not only in a policy page): “Individual outcomes vary; incentives are discretionary and not guaranteed.” This aligns with the revised Endorsement Guides (2023) on typicality and clear connections. (Federal Register)
4.5 Simulated performance disclaimers (turnkey line)
Place this next to any chart/metric that could be read as real trading performance:
“Hypothetical/simulated performance has inherent limitations and does not represent actual trading; results may differ materially in live market conditions.”
This mimics CFTC Rule 4.41 / NFA 2 29 proximity norms (best practice, even if we aren’t registrants). (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)
5) Pattern Library — consistent components for Design & Dev
P1. Disclosure Endcap (hero container)
•	Where: Bottom of hero container (desktop & mobile above the fold).
•	Spec: min 12–13px on mobile; same font family; 80–90% of body size; high contrast; aria describedby from headline anchor.
•	Content: Short form disclosure (Section 4.1). (Federal Trade Commission)
P2. Methods Popover (for $57M badge)
•	Trigger: “Method & period ➜”
•	Content: Definition of “discretionary incentives,” date range, inclusion/exclusion logic; link to full page. Log the methodology (substantiation file). (Federal Trade Commission)
P3. Sim Caution Pill
•	Where: Adjacent to any performance visualization/leaderboard.
•	Content: 4.41/2 29 style caution (Section 4.5). (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)
P4. Checkout Acknowledgment
•	Above pay button: “I understand I’m purchasing access to an educational simulation & assessment. Payouts are discretionary and require E8’s acceptance & data licensing.”
•	Log: Timestamp + text version for evidence. (Federal Trade Commission)
P5. Phrasebook Tokens (CMS snippets)
•	Allowed: “No live capital or margin risk,” “Discretionary incentives,” “Educational simulation,” “Incentive disbursements.”
•	Blocked: “Zero risk” (unqualified), “Risk free payouts,” “Guaranteed payout,” “Profit withdrawals.”
(Use CMS linting or PR checklist to enforce.) 
6) Matrix — placements, copy, and risk posture (for devs & copywriters)
Surface	Allowed headline	Required adjacent text	Placement notes	Risk posture
Homepage hero	Zero live capital risk. (or) No live capital or margin risk.	Fees purchase educational simulation & assessment. Incentives are discretionary; subject to acceptance & data licensing.	Inline under headline (A) or hero endcap † (B)	Low (A) / Low Mod (B)
$57M badge	$57,0XX,XXX since [Start]	Discretionary incentives across E8 programs; methodology & period.	Badge + popover methods	Low
Payout stream	Live incentive disbursements — updated every 60s	Amounts are incentives, not trading profits.	On module header	Low
Testimonials	Keep quotes	Typical outcomes vary; incentives discretionary.	Same module card	Low–Mod
Program tiles	“Trade without risking your live capital”	All trading simulated; incentives discretionary.	Under tile CTAs	Low–Mod
Checkout	—	Acknowledgment checkbox text (P4)	Above pay button	Low
(If space is constrained on mobile, drop secondary flourishes before you drop disclosures.) (Federal Trade Commission)
7) Education for the internal team — shift the mental model
Legacy prop firm thinking: “I pay to access capital and share profits.”

E8 SIMFI frame: “I pay tuition for a structured simulation & assessment. My data may be licensed, and E8 may choose to pay a discretionary incentive.”
Use these one liners internally and externally:
•	“You’re not buying capital. You’re buying capability.”
•	“No live capital or margin risk — by design.”
•	“Payouts ≠ profits; they’re discretionary incentives tied to licensed performance data.”
These reinforce the ESPA’s classification and keep the FTC’s net impression test on our side. (Federal Trade Commission)
8) Worst case analysis (what’s the real downside?)
•	Most likely friction: Inquiry letter or CID demanding substantiation for “zero risk”/“57M”/“updated every 60s” and clarity around payouts.
•	Potential outcome: Copy changes, fencing in provisions, compliance reporting, and consumer redress or civil penalties in rule/order contexts (see Intuit order; H&R Block settlement). Not a “cheap cost of doing business.” Orders narrow your future creative runway. (Federal Trade Commission)
9) Page ready copy blocks (drop in; keep cadence)
Hero — Version B (assertive, balanced):
Simulated capital. Real training. Zero live capital risk.
You’re purchasing access to an educational simulation & assessment. Any payout is discretionary—not guaranteed—and requires E8’s acceptance & licensing of your performance data.
$57M badge:
$57,0XX,XXX in discretionary incentives since [Start Date]. Method & period ➜
Payout stream header:
Live incentive disbursements — updated every 60 seconds
Discretionary amounts from the simulation program; not trading profits. 
Sim caution (adjacent to any performance viz):
Hypothetical/simulated performance has inherent limitations and does not represent actual trading; results may differ materially in live market conditions. (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)
FAQ primer (tight):
You’re not buying capital; you’re buying a structured simulation and assessment. Incentives, if any, are discretionary and depend on E8’s acceptance and licensing of your performance data. 
10) Ops & QA — acceptance criteria you can ship on
•	Proximity evidence: Capture device screenshots showing the qualifier in the same viewport as the triggering claim (hero and $57M). Archive to a compliance folder. (Federal Trade Commission)
•	ARIA association: Headline anchor (†) aria describedby → hero endcap ID.
•	Methods page: Public doc with computational logic and date range for the $57M tally; link used sitewide wherever the stat appears. (Federal Trade Commission)
•	Testimonials: Either remove specific dollars/timing or add the typicality line on card. (Federal Register)
•	CMS guardrails: “Blocked/Allowed Phrases” linter; PR checklist includes disclosure present? method link present? sim caution present?
•	Checkout checkbox: Required to proceed; log the acceptance text + timestamp. (Federal Trade Commission)
11) Portable explainers (for other pages & funnels)
Short explainer (top of category or page footer block):
E8 is a SaaS educational simulation built for skills training, data collection, and analytical modeling. There is no live capital or margin risk. Enrollment fees purchase access to the simulation & assessment; payouts are discretionary, not guaranteed, and contingent on E8’s acceptance & licensing of your performance data.
Sidebar explainer (cards, PDPs, blog posts):
•	What you buy: Simulation + assessment access
•	What you avoid: Live capital & margin risk
•	How payouts work: Discretionary incentives based on licensed performance data; not trading profits
•	Why it exists: Train discipline, collect data, and reward repeatable skill

2.	Approve $57M badge + Methods popover and stream rename to “incentive disbursements.” 
3.	Approve Sim caution pill standard for all performance visuals. (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)
4.	Green light Phrasebook Tokens and CMS linter.

•	ESPA §1.3 – Educational Purpose
“Participant’s engagement is solely for educational purposes—not for investment, speculation, or financial gain. Participant agrees not to portray the Platform as offering investment opportunities.”
•	Discretionary Incentives & Data Licensing
“All performance incentives are purely discretionary, based on internal criteria, and contingent upon E8’s acceptance and license of participant performance data.”
Mirror these anchors in the site’s “How payouts work & what you’re buying” explainer and at checkout.
Bottom line: We keep the heat, narrow the risk, and move the qualifier into a hero endcap pattern that protects the net impression while preserving our conversion cadence. That’s how E8 leads SIMFI as the smart, blue chip player in a market still speaking the old prop firm dialect.
