E8 Markets Neural Codex — Simulated Finance Category Playbook
Master Copywriting Research · Publication-Ready (Chunk 1/8: Cover, System Prompt, Executive Snapshot, Guardrails)
Cover / Purpose
What if your best trades paid you before you ever risked real money?
This Codex trains humans and LLMs to create precise, persuasive, compliant content for e8markets.com. It defines our category, audience, voice, objections, and rules—so every ad, page, email, or script stays on-avatar and on-brand.
System Prompt (paste into your GPT)
You are the E8 Markets Neural Codex. Write in ABS structure (Audience • Beliefs/Barriers • Solution/System) with curiosity headlines, Gestalt emphasis, sensory precision, and rule-first clarity.
Always include: simulated environment; risk model: EOD (closed-balance) or Trailing (peak-following); clear targets/milestones with nearby dollar math; payouts: USD via bank transfer or crypto (USDC/USDT/XRP/ETH/BTC) after a one-time $1 wallet verification—crypto rails only; community + analytics; and the Consent Line when performance data is referenced:
“With user consent, we analyze performance data to refine coaching and safeguards; we never market user trades as investments.”
Messaging Ladder (order): Motive (earn) → Safety (protective risk model + sim) → Method (targets/milestones) → Proof (payout rails & analytics) → Category (Simulated Finance) → Compliance.
Vocabulary Guardrails
Do not use: funded accounts, prop firm (as identity), guaranteed profits, live account funding.
Do use: Simulated Finance, simulated environment, EOD or Trailing, targets/milestones, payouts (USD/crypto), community coaching, analytics.
Executive Snapshot (for Humans & LLMs)
Not a prop firm. E8 Markets = Simulated Finance (SimFi).
A paid, rules-based training + performance program where traders use simulated capital on live-fidelity market data, follow EOD or Trailing risk models, hit clearly defined targets, and withdraw real payouts (USD bank transfer or crypto after one-time $1 wallet verification, crypto rails only).
Why people come: money motive first (supplement → freedom), with skill growth under rules they trust.
To date: tens of millions paid to traders.
Voice DNA: proof-first, anti-casino, plain-English, disciplined coach energy.
NLP anchors: contrast (EOD vs Trailing), future pacing (“on your second milestone withdrawal…”), embedded commands (Lock your rules. Trade your plan. Cash the milestone.), kinesthetic cues (“pullbacks breathe,” “clean runway”).
Knowledge-Base Guardrails (must appear across assets)
•	State the category: E8 is Simulated Finance (reference “prop firm” only for comparison, never identity).
•	Name the risk model: EOD (closed-balance) or Trailing (peak-following)—and explain the trade-off in plain English.
•	Show target/milestone math with dollars (e.g., 2.5% on $100k = $2,500 as illustration).
•	Payout rails: USD via bank transfer; crypto after one-time $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only).
•	Simulated environment + performance-based payouts—no income guarantees; no live account funding claims.
•	Futures note: positions liquidate at rollover; next-day risk = prior day’s closed balance.
•	Consent Line verbatim when referencing performance data.
•	One micro-CTA sized to a 90–180 minute session (e.g., Start Signature • Compare EOD vs Trailing • Cash Your First Milestone).

Program Families + Configurator UX
Curiosity Hook: Pick the Path That Pays You Back
What if the right rules felt like a custom cockpit?
Signature, One, Classic, Track, Track 1:1—each family maps to a temperament. Keep your platform. Choose your risk model. Hit target → withdraw → continue.
3.1 Program Families — Quick Map (no pricing, no % specifics)
Use in copy: name the family, the risk model, the fit, and one proof object. Defer numbers to the on-site configurator/Product Sheet.
E8 Signature (1-Step • EOD)
•	Fit: Beginner → Intermediate. Fastest way to a believable first withdrawal.
•	Risk model: EOD (closed-balance) = pullbacks breathe; no phantom liquidations.
•	Why it wins: plain-English rules; standardized across markets; confidence early.
•	Proof object: progress bar + wallet verification tile.
•	Micro-CTA: Start Signature QuickStart → Watch Payout Walkthrough (3 min).
E8 One (1-Step • Trailing)

•	Why it wins: momentum feel; sharper discipline feedback.
•	Proof object: EOD vs Trailing contrast card.
•	Micro-CTA: Compare EOD vs Trailing → Run 10-Session Trial.
E8 Classic (2-Step)
•	Fit: Intermediate → Advanced who prefer a phased pass.
•	Risk model: set by chosen account type (often EOD).
•	Why it wins: familiar “classic” path; mid-price psychology.
•	Proof object: phase timeline + pass-to-payout diagram.
•	Micro-CTA: Begin Phase 1 → See Pass → Payout Timeline.
E8 Track (3-Step • Regular)

Platform continuity across families (availability varies): Match-Trader, cTrader, TradeLocker.
Payout rails across families: USD bank transfer or crypto after one-time $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only).
3.2 Risk Model Quick-Compare — Plain English
Curiosity Headline: We Don’t Count What You Almost Had. We Count What You Keep.
Subhead: Choose EOD for breathing room or Trailing for momentum—write the reason in the first paragraph.
Risk Model	How It Measures Risk	Feels Best For	Common Misread	Copy Cue
EOD (Closed-Balance)	Drawdown based on yesterday’s closed balance. Intraday highs don’t raise your risk bar.	Pullback-tolerant, mean-reversion, learning phases, risk-averse	“Too lenient.” (Reality: protects good trades; still enforces daily loss.)	“Pullbacks breathe. Good trades live.”
Trailing (Peak-Following)	Drawdown moves up with new intraday equity highs.	Momentum continuation, trend riders, tight discipline	“It nukes winners.” (Reality: it punishes giving back peaks—by design.)	“Ride the tape. Respect new peaks.”
Futures note: Positions liquidate at rollover; next-day risk is based on prior day’s closed balance.
3.3 Configurator UX — Six Choices, One Golden Rule
Curiosity Headline: Six Dials. One Rule: Don’t Over-Tweak on Day One.
Subhead: Steps • Account Type • Platform • Balance • Drawdown • Payout Share. Begin Signature defaults, change one variable at a time.
The Six Dials (in this order):
1.	Steps → 1 / 2 / 3 (speed vs practice gates)
2.	Account Type → Signature / One / Classic / Track / Track 1:1 (sets risk model by family)
3.	Platform → Match-Trader / cTrader / TradeLocker (keep muscle memory)
4.	Balance → $5k–$500k simulated (start small if confidence is low)
5.	Drawdown → breathing room setting (higher room = higher plan price)
6.	Payout Share → your split (higher share often = higher plan price)
Golden Rule: Start standard (Signature/EOD), then test one change for ten sessions.
•	If your distribution tightens and plan adherence ≥ 80%, keep the change.
•	If variance expands or adherence drops, revert to default and test a different single variable.
Proof Objects to Show in Copy:
•	EOD vs Trailing contrast card
•	Plan-adherence streak tile (process > outcome)
•	Milestone calculator (show $ near %)
•	Payout rails UI (bank transfer + one-time $1 wallet verification for crypto)

Promise in Plain Sight + ABS Core
Curiosity Hook
If discipline is the skill, why not pay it like one?
Simulated Finance turns rule-true practice on live-fidelity data into real withdrawals—USD bank transfer or crypto after a one-time $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only). Choose EOD or Trailing, hit a target, withdraw, continue.
4.1 The Promise in Plain Sight (Universal Block)
Headline: Train Like a Pro. Get Paid for Proof.
Subhead: Same charts. Safer runway. Real withdrawals.
•	What it is: Simulated Finance—a paid, rules-based training + performance program using simulated capital on live-fidelity market data with performance-based payouts.
•	Why it matters (money motive first): People don’t join to collect badges—they join to collect withdrawals. We convert discipline → dollars with protective rules that keep good trades alive.
•	How it works (short): learn → simulate → qualify → earn. Choose EOD (closed-balance) or Trailing (peak-following), follow clear targets/milestones, withdraw when you hit them, continue.
•	Payout rails: USD bank transfer or crypto (USDC/USDT/XRP/ETH/BTC) after a one-time $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only).
•	Milestone clarity (illustration only): e.g., 2.5% on $100k = $2,500. Always show $ near %.
•	Rule shield:
o	EOD (closed-balance): calculates against yesterday’s closed balance → pullbacks breathe; no phantom liquidation.
o	Trailing (peak-following): ratchets with intraday equity highs → momentum feel; respects new peaks.
•	Transition mantra: You bring discipline; E8 supplies the cockpit (analytics), the tower (coach-community), and the runway (risk model + milestones).
Futures note: Positions liquidate at rollover; next-day risk is based on prior day’s closed balance.
Consent Line (include when data is referenced): “With user consent, we analyze performance data to refine coaching and safeguards; we never market user trades as investments.”
Micro-CTAs (pick by segment): Start Signature QuickStart • Compare EOD vs Trailing • Lock 2-Hour Session • Confirm Payout Rails
4.2 ABS Core — Audience • Beliefs/Barriers • Solution/System (Base Copy)
A — Audience (segmented reality)
Self-funded traders in Forex • Futures • Crypto across three bands:
•	Beginners: safe runway to first withdrawal; plain language; standardized rules.
•	Intermediates: structure after scars; clarity on risk rules & payouts; proof over promises.
•	Experienced/Pro: pressure test that pays; platform continuity; analytics depth.
Common thread: money motive now → financial freedom later; time-boxed sessions (90–180 min); rule sensitivity.
B — Beliefs & Barriers (what they think, what stops them)
•	Dominant beliefs: “Brokers play games.” “Trailing nukes winners.” “More leverage = faster.”
•	Barriers: payout skepticism, choice overload (drawdown/share), circadian limits, shame after blowups.
•	Neutralizers (what we show):
o	Protective risk model: EOD or Trailing (plain-English trade-offs).
o	Milestone rhythm: Hit target → Withdraw → Continue (show $ near %).
o	Payout proof: USD bank transfer or crypto after $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only).
o	Discipline aids: max-3 decisions, cool-down locks, plan-adherence streaks.
o	Community + analytics: millisecond journaling; edge-vs-variance tiles.
S — Solution & System (how E8 reframes the game)
1.	Experiential learning in real time
Live-fidelity data; journaling to the millisecond; analytics that separate edge vs variance; coach-layer community.
2.	One-Step or Three-Stage → Earn
Self-select by skill and stake. Failure = training signal, not identity.
3.	Payouts engine (not promises)
Hit target → Withdraw (USD bank transfer or crypto after $1 verification for crypto rails) → Continue.
4.	Rules that protect (choose your runway)
o	EOD (closed-balance): preserves good trades through normal pullbacks; no phantom liquidation.
o	Trailing (peak-following): tightens as you print new highs; suits momentum playbooks.
Copy cue: “We don’t count what you almost had—we count what you kept.”

Compliance anchors (keep visible): simulated environment; name the risk model (EOD or Trailing); performance-based payouts; USD bank transfer or crypto after one-time $1 wallet verification; no guarantees; futures rollover note when relevant; Consent Line if you mention performance data.
BEGINNER — “First Win, Not First Risk”
Section headline: Paper That Pays? Yes—When Discipline Triggers Dollars.
Subhead: Live-fidelity practice, EOD breathing room, and real withdrawals (bank transfer or crypto after $1 wallet verification).
External objections (answers):
1.	“Is this just paper?”
Answer: It’s a simulated environment on live-fidelity market data. When you hit the milestone, you withdraw real money—USD bank transfer or crypto after a one-time $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only).
Proof: payout rails UI + wallet-status tile.
2.	“What’s drawdown?”
Answer: Your max allowed loss. EOD checks once per day using yesterday’s closed balance so pullbacks can breathe; Trailing follows intraday peaks for a momentum feel.
Proof: EOD vs Trailing card (1-paragraph explainer).
3.	“Which option should I pick?”
Answer: Start Signature (EOD)—plain rules, simplest to first withdrawal. Customize one variable after you gain consistency.
Proof: progress bar + “Change One Variable” tip.
Three common internal dialogues around those external objections:
•	“If it’s simulated, I won’t take it seriously.” → “Withdrawals make practice real.”
•	“I’ll pick wrong and waste money.” → “Start standard; change one dial later.”
•	“I don’t speak trader.” → “Zero-jargon glossary + 3-minute payout walkthrough.”
Internal objections (answers):
•	“I don’t want to pick wrong.” → Start Signature/EOD, then adjust one setting after 10 sessions.
•	“My partner won’t believe it.” → Normalize small, frequent withdrawals; show progress bar.
•	“I don’t have time.” → 90-minute session preset; max-3 decisions; cool-downs prevent tilt.
Three internal dialogues to surface + resolve:
•	“If I don’t win today, I’ll spiral.” → “Two losses end the session—not the week.”
•	“I chase when I’m tired.” → “Cool-down lock turns off the casino brain.”
•	“Math intimidates me.” → “We always show dollars near percents.”
Micro-CTA: Start Signature QuickStart → Watch Payout Walkthrough (3 min).
INTERMEDIATE — “Structure After Scars”
Section headline: Breathe Through the Pullback. Punish Only Rule Breaks.
Subhead: EOD for runway; cool-downs and max-3 decisions; tens of millions paid to traders to date.
External objections (answers):
1.	“Do you actually pay?”
Answer: Yes—USD bank transfer or crypto after one-time $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only). Cadence is transparent. To date: tens of millions paid to traders.
Proof: payout cadence/timeline tile + rails UI.
2.	“Why does the price change when I move drawdown or payout share?”
Answer: More breathing room (higher drawdown) or higher payout share increases plan risk; price reflects that trade-off. Start standard; adjust one dial after 10 sessions.
Proof: configurator deltas explainer.
3.	“EOD vs Trailing—will I get nuked again?”
Answer: EOD uses closed balance so normal pullbacks don’t trigger a liquidation; Trailing ratchets with peaks for momentum traders.
Proof: contrast card; add a one-line example.
Three internal dialogues around those external objections:
•	“Last time, they moved the goalposts.” → “Risk model and milestones are stated up front—no surprise hoops.”
•	“Payouts always have strings.” → “Bank transfer or crypto after $1 verification; timeline displayed.”
•	“If I change settings, I’ll over-fit.” → “Ten-session rule: one change at a time or it’s not a test.”
Internal objections (answers):
•	“I tilt after losses.” → Max-3 decisions, cool-downs, end session after two losses.
•	“I don’t trust my judgment mid-day.” → Study Hall replaces live trading outside your window.
•	“Partner buy-in is shaky.” → Smaller, more frequent withdrawals rebuild trust.
Three internal dialogues to surface + resolve:
•	“If I sit out, I’m missing money.” → “Flat protects the milestone; FOMO is a fee.”
•	“I need to make it back.” → “Process streaks pay later; revenge trades charge interest now.”
•	“I can’t track all this.” → “Millisecond journaling + edge vs variance tags handle the bookkeeping.”
Micro-CTA: Lock 2-Hour Session → Journal in 60 seconds.
ADVANCED — “Keep Your Platform. Upgrade Your Telemetry.”
Section headline: One Variable at a Time—or It’s Not a Test.
Subhead: Compare EOD (breathing room) vs Trailing (momentum); run 10-session trials with telemetry.
External objections (answers):
1.	“Platform lock-in?”
Answer: Keep Match-Trader, cTrader, or TradeLocker (availability varies). We add analytics + journaling + payout rails.
Proof: platform badges + “keep your hotkeys” note.
2.	“Hidden gotchas?”
Answer: Simulated environment; risk model named; milestones clear; USD bank transfer or crypto after $1 verification (crypto rails only); no live-funding claims, no guarantees.
Proof: compliance checklist aside.
3.	“Is Trailing just punishment?”
Answer: It’s peak-following for momentum edges. Prefer EOD for pullback breathing room; pick per playbook.
Proof: side-by-side examples (one line each).
Three internal dialogues around those external objections:
•	“If I tweak two dials, I’ll never know which helped.” → “Ten-session single-change protocol.”
•	“I don’t want more software—just better signal.” → “Telemetry overlays your current platform.”
•	“I’ll forget to journal.” → “60-second auto-prompts after each decision.”
Internal objections (answers):
•	“I over-tune mid-session.” → lock settings during session; change in weekly review only.
•	“I need distributions, not anecdotes.” → edge vs variance charts + session KPIs.
•	“I want clean exports.” → one-click CSV/JSON (where available); keep your research flow.
Three internal dialogues to surface + resolve:
•	“If variance widens, I’ll chase.” → “Variance tag triggers smaller size on next entry.”
•	“My win rate dropped.” → “Check average R; don’t fire the system mid-week.”
•	“I can’t test everything.” → “Instrument caps (2–3) for signal purity.”
Micro-CTA: Compare EOD vs Trailing → Run a 10-Session Trial.
PRO / EXPERIENCED — “Performance In. Payout Out.”
Section headline: Cash Cadence Without the Casino.
Subhead: Low-friction evaluations; bank transfer or crypto after $1 verification; rules stated up front.
External objections (answers):
1.	“Prop challenge in disguise?”
Answer: No—Simulated Finance in a simulated environment with performance-based payouts. We don’t claim to fund your live account.
Proof: category statement + compliance block.
2.	“Payout friction or delays?”
Answer: USD bank transfer or crypto after one-time $1 wallet verification; cadence and timelines are transparent.
Proof: payout timeline UI.
3.	“Will you move the goalposts?”
Answer: Risk model (EOD or Trailing) and milestones are published; no hidden hoops.
Proof: pass→payout checklist.
Three internal dialogues around those external objections:
•	“Time is my scarce resource.” → “90–120 minute sessions; max-3 decisions; session lockouts prevent drift.”
•	“If rails stutter, I’m out.” → “Rails UI visible before you start; verify once for crypto.”
•	“Don’t sell me a course.” → “This is training plus a payout engine, not content for content’s sake.”
Internal objections (answers):
•	“I won’t journal.” → 60-second post-trade prompts; export to your stack.
•	“Team will ask for proof.” → analytics dashboard + payout receipts.
•	“I need to protect reputation.” → simulated environment; compliance-safe language; no live-funding claims.
Three internal dialogues to surface + resolve:
•	“Show me rails, then get out of my way.” → “Confirm rails → Begin evaluation window.”
•	“If I can’t port data, I won’t start.” → “Exports available; keep your research pipeline.”
•	“Don’t waste my first session.” → “Pre-flight checklist enforces focus in minute one.”
Micro-CTA: Confirm Payout Rails → Begin Evaluation Window.

Day-in-the-Life — Two Hours, Three Decisions, One Payout Habit
Curiosity Hook
What if a 120-minute ritual could turn discipline into deposits?
Simulated environment. EOD (closed-balance) or Trailing (peak-following). Hit target → Withdraw → Continue. Payouts via USD bank transfer or crypto after a one-time $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only).
6.1 AM Session (example)
6:15 AM — Wake & Intention (2 min)
•	Symptom: bills on the counter; low-grade anxiety.
•	Inner line: “Two clean decisions > ten random clicks.”
•	Copy cue: Name the risk model up front. Today: EOD for breathing room.
6:25 AM — Pre-Flight (10 min)
•	Open watchlist template → mark skip conditions (major news, sleep debt).
•	Select 2–3 instruments max; one A+ setup.
•	Proof object: “A+ setup filter” tile + EOD vs Trailing micro-card.
•	Embedded command: Lock your rules. Trade your plan.
6:37 AM — Risk Frame (2 min)
•	EOD: drawdown based on yesterday’s closed balance → pullbacks breathe; no phantom liquidation.
•	Trailing (if used): ratchets with intraday peaks → momentum feel; respect new highs.
•	Micro-note: show $ near % (e.g., 0.6% on $100k = $600 illustration).
7:00–8:20 AM — Execution Window (≤3 decisions)
•	One position at a time; cool-down after each decision; two losses ends session.
•	Self-talk moments:
o	“Spread widened—skip.”
o	“Break-even at +0.7R. Let it work.”
o	“Flat protects the milestone.”
•	Proof objects: max-3 decisions tile • cool-down timer tile • plan-adherence streak tile.
8:25 AM — Payout Reassurance (2 min)
•	Artifact: Payout rails UI (bank transfer / crypto status) + wallet verified: yes/no.
•	Inner line: “When I tag the milestone, I’ll request.”
8:30 AM — Journal & Review (7 min)
•	Use 60-second micro-journal (below), then Coach Prompts.
•	Tag edge vs variance; note 1 improvement for tomorrow.
6.2 PM Session (mirror to AM)
8:15 PM — Reset & Intention → name risk model; cap to 2 instruments.
8:25 PM — Pre-Flight → skip rule: no new positions within 30 min of curfew.
8:40–10:00 PM — Execution → identical discipline; more caution if using Trailing late.
10:03 PM — Journal & Rails Check → progress bar + payout rails; lights-out ritual (see template).
6.3 Weekend Crypto Protocol (24/7 hazard control)
•	Curfew: hard stop at 90 minutes.
•	Setup: one A+ pattern; no revenge trades.
•	Risk model: EOD preferred to reduce overnight tilt.
•	Journal seed: “Skipped second candle spike; waited for retest.”
•	CTA: Lock Weekend Session (90 min) → Run the curfew.
6.4 Event-Day Protocol (Forex/Futures)
•	Skip first 5 minutes after major releases (CPI, NFP, FOMC).
•	Retest only at structure; halve size on first entry.
•	Risk model note: Trailing is unforgiving during spikes; prefer EOD unless momentum is your edge.
•	CTA: Activate Event-Day Rules → Retest-only entry.
6.5 Journal Templates (copy/paste)
A) 60-Second Micro-Journal (post-decision)
•	Setup taken? (Y/N) Why this, not others?
•	Risk model today: (EOD/Trailing) — Did it help? (Y/N)
•	Outcome tag: Edge / Variance (circle one)
•	Process score (0–3): entries, exits, size discipline
•	One improvement tomorrow: ___________
B) 7-Minute Debrief (end of session)
•	What happened (facts): # decisions, net %/$ toward milestone (illustration ok).
•	What I felt: urge to chase / hesitate / fatigue.
•	Rule check: stayed within max-3? used cool-down?
•	Edge vs Variance: evidence for each; what sample size says.
•	Playbook note: keep / tweak one variable next 10 sessions.
•	Payout readiness: progress bar % + $; rails status (bank / crypto verified).
•	Consent line (if analyzing): With user consent, we analyze performance data to refine coaching and safeguards; we never market user trades as investments.
C) Lights-Out Reset (30 seconds)
•	Win or flat: “Process paid; tomorrow is another 120-minute block.”
•	Loss: “Two losses ended the day, not the week. Cool-down complete.”
•	Micro-visualization: first clean setup tomorrow; journal prompt after.
6.6 Proof-Object Pack (drop-in UI modules)

Variables 1–12 Copy Matrix — Plug-and-Write
How to use this matrix: Start with the Universal line for each variable. Then apply the Segment Overlay for audience_tier = beginner | intermediate | advanced | pro. Add flavor using an Archetype Micro-hook (engineer | hustler | monk | gamer | quant | macro | rebuilder). Keep outputs program-agnostic; defer specific %/prices to the Product Sheet.
Curiosity Hook
Twelve levers. One outcome: copy that pays discipline—not deposits.
Name the risk model (EOD closed-balance or Trailing peak-following). Show a milestone with $ near %. Spell out payout rails: USD bank transfer or crypto after a one-time $1 wallet verification (crypto rails only).
1) AUDIENCE you’re marketing to
Universal
Self-funded traders in Forex • Futures • Crypto who want cash now → freedom later, operating in 90–180-minute sessions, allergic to “gotcha” rules, motivated by proof (payout rails, analytics, community).
Segment Overlay
•	Beginner: first withdrawal > first risk; plain-English rules; EOD default.
•	Intermediate: structure after scars; cool-downs; EOD first, Trailing explained.
•	Advanced: platform continuity; telemetry; one-variable-at-a-time testing.
•	Pro: low friction; rails clarity; evaluation → payout cadence.
Archetype Micro-hooks
Engineer: “Define, diagram, decide.” • Hustler: “Two hours → payout.” • Monk: “Ritual over rush.” • Gamer: “Win the streak; respect cool-downs.” • Quant: “Tag variance; protect edge.” • Macro: “Skip the spike; trade the retest.” • Rebuilder: “Trust is built in small payouts.”
2) PROBLEM your product solves
Universal
Live capital is expensive tuition; “prop challenges” feel like theater; risk rules are confusing (EOD vs Trailing); choice overload (drawdown/payout share) wrecks discipline; payouts seem opaque.
Segment Overlay
•	Beginner: fear of picking wrong; jargon walls.
•	Intermediate: tilt/revenge trading; distrust of payout hoops.
•	Advanced: hidden gotchas; tinker-drift mid-session.
•	Pro: time cost; payout friction; data portability.
3) PROMISE (BENEFIT)
Universal
A safer, clearer path to real withdrawals: train on simulated capital with EOD or Trailing, hit transparent milestones, and withdraw real money (USD bank transfer or crypto after $1 wallet verification, crypto rails only) with coaching + analytics that make performance legible and repeatable.
Segment Overlay
•	Beginner: Signature/EOD defaults → first believable withdrawal fast.
•	Intermediate: cool-downs + max-3 decisions → structure that pays.
•	Advanced: telemetry + 10-session trials → refine edge without noise.
•	Pro: low-friction evals + payout timeline → cash cadence, no theater.
4) Top 5 MYTHS
Universal
1.	There’s one “best” configuration for everyone.
2.	“Funded accounts” mean a firm funds your live account.
3.	More leverage/drawdown = faster success.
4.	Trailing is always fairer.
5.	Paper trading can’t be real.
Segment Overlay Notes
•	Beginner: Translate “drawdown” as max allowed loss.
•	Intermediate: Rebut “more dials = better edge.”
•	Advanced/Pro: Rebut “metrics without cash don’t matter”—payout rails prove it.
5) Top 5 MISTAKES
Universal
1.	Over-customizing on day one.
2.	Over-trading; no cool-downs.
3.	Size whiplash after wins/losses.
4.	Skipping pre-flight (skip rules, A+ setup).
5.	No journaling / mis-tagging edge vs variance.
Segment Emphasis
•	Beginner: 1,4,5 • Intermediate: 2,3 • Advanced: 1,5 • Pro: 2,5

2.	Start Signature defaults; change one variable per 10 sessions.
3.	Milestones rewire dopamine: Hit → Withdraw → Continue.
4.	Small, frequent withdrawals build household trust.
5.	Max-3 decisions + cool-downs beat indicator roulette.
7) Top 5 ALTERNATIVES
Universal
1.	Trade your own live account (tuition is expensive).
2.	Retail prop challenges with trailing hoops.
3.	DIY courses (no live-fidelity reps + payout reinforcement).
4.	Copy-trading/signals (borrowed conviction).

8) SOLUTION TYPE
Universal
Simulated Finance (SimFi) — paid, rules-based training + performance on simulated capital with real payouts (USD bank transfer or crypto after $1 wallet verification, crypto rails only).
9) POSITIONING
Universal

8.2 LLM Writing Recipes (paste into briefs)
Blog/Guide Recipe
Write a [guide/blog/FAQ] for audience_tier = {beginner|intermediate|advanced|pro} and archetype = {engineer|hustler|monk|gamer|quant|macro|rebuilder}. Lead with Simulated Finance, the chosen risk model (EOD or Trailing), and one milestone with $ near %. State payout rails (USD bank transfer; crypto after one-time $1 wallet verification). Include one external and one internal objection with short dialogue. End with a session-sized CTA.
Landing Page Recipe
Hero = curiosity headline + subhead + payout rails. Mid = EOD vs Trailing card + configurator on-ramp. Proof = milestone calculator + pass→payout timeline. CTA = tier-appropriate micro-CTA.
FAQ Recipe
Each FAQ follows Acknowledge → Translate → Prove → Invite, with a proof object beside the answer. Include the Consent Line when referencing data analysis.
8.3 Plain-English Glossary (copy block)
•	Simulated environment: practice with simulated capital on live-fidelity data; payouts come from performance milestones—not live account funding.
•	EOD (closed-balance) drawdown: daily risk uses yesterday’s closed balance; intraday highs don’t raise the risk bar.
•	Trailing (peak-following) drawdown: the risk bar ratchets up as intraday equity makes new highs.
•	Daily loss limit: max you can lose in one day under the rules.
•	Milestone/target: the performance threshold that triggers pass or payout eligibility.
•	Payout share: your percentage of a qualifying payout (e.g., 80/90/100%).
•	Configurator: tool for choosing steps, account family, platform, balance, drawdown, payout share.
•	Futures rollover: open positions are liquidated at rollover; next-day risk is based on prior day’s closed balance.
•	Consent Line: “With user consent, we analyze performance data to refine coaching and safeguards; we never market user trades as investments.”
