Writing Technique #1: Relevance in Copywriting
Purpose:
Relevance is the cornerstone of effective copywriting, where the goal is to connect directly with the reader's current thoughts and emotional state. Relevance allows the writer to align the message with the reader's internal dialogue and emotional framework, creating a strong, empathetic connection.

•	The Role of Relevance in Copywriting
•	Semantic and Emotional Relevance
•	Examples of Relevance
•	How to Apply Relevance in Copywriting
•	Mastering Relevance for Effective Copywriting
 
1. The Role of Relevance in Copywriting
We live in a society saturated with marketing messages. As such, human attention has become an economic commodity. For a message to resonate with readers, it must immediately connect with something they are already thinking about — their internal dialogue — or feeling emotionally.
The primary goal of relevance is to make this connection. A failure to be relevant results in wasted effort. This is called “Pick-Up Line Marketing,” where an attempt to grab attention is made without creating any meaningful connection. The reader may notice the message but is unlikely to engage.
Instead, we aim to step into the reader’s internal world by crafting messages that join the conversation already happening in their mind. This increases the likelihood of getting the reader to engage with the content and ultimately respond to the call to action.
 
2. Semantic and Emotional Relevance
Relevance can be broken down into two main categories:
1.	Semantic Relevance: This refers to matching the words and thoughts that are already part of the reader's internal dialogue. It answers the question, "What is the reader thinking about right now?"
o	Example: A parent worried about a teenager might think, “She better not be with that boy she brought home last week!” Matching this internal dialogue captures the reader’s attention because it mirrors their exact concerns.
2.	Emotional Relevance: This goes deeper than semantic relevance, addressing the emotional context that drives the reader’s thoughts. It answers the question, "What is the reader feeling?"
o	Example: That same parent might be feeling fear, frustration, or anxiety. If the message taps into these emotions, it becomes far more powerful because it not only mirrors their thoughts but also acknowledges their emotional state.
 
3. Examples of Relevance in Copywriting
Example 1: Semantic Relevance Imagine a reader who is an athlete and experiences recurring elbow pain. They’ve tried everything — from stretching to online remedies — and the pain persists. When this person sees a headline like:
"What’s With this pinching pain in my right elbow?"
They are likely to continue reading because it connects directly with their internal dialogue. It’s not clever or catchy for the sake of it; it’s highly relevant.
Example 2: Emotional Relevance Take a reader who is a 52-year-old man noticing swollen ankles. He might not realize that this could be linked to a more severe health issue. A headline like:
"Are Your Swollen Ankles a Warning of a Coming Heart Attack?"
Creates not only semantic relevance (it addresses his swollen ankles) but also emotional relevance (it taps into his fear and concern for his health). This drives engagement because it mirrors both his internal thoughts and emotional concerns.
 
4. How to Apply Relevance in Copywriting
To effectively apply relevance in copywriting, follow these steps:
1.	Define the Buyer Persona: Start by understanding who your reader is. What are their typical thoughts, fears, desires, and pain points?
2.	Understand Their Day: Map out a typical day for your reader. When and where does the problem you’re addressing occur in their life? How does this issue affect them daily?
3.	Identify Internal Dialogue: What are they thinking about the problem your product solves? Identify key phrases or thoughts that represent this internal dialogue.
4.	Tap Into Emotional Context: What emotions are behind their internal thoughts? Are they feeling frustrated, anxious, or hopeful? Use this to make the message emotionally resonant.
 
5. Mastering Relevance in Copywriting
Empathy is the key to mastering relevance. The more deeply you understand the problem your reader faces, the better you can connect with their thoughts and emotions.
When you gather insights about your reader, you can write in a way that not only captures their attention but also holds it, ensuring they engage with your message. By practicing relevance, you are well on your way to becoming an effective and empathetic copywriter who connects meaningfully with your audience.
 
Summary:
•	Semantic Relevance aligns your message with the reader’s thoughts.
•	Emotional Relevance resonates with their feelings.
•	Connecting with both ensures your message is powerful and compelling.

Curiosity in Copywriting
 
Technique #2: Curiosity in Copywriting
Article #2 from the series, 10 Persuasive Copywriting Techniques
 
Topics Covered in This Article

Curiosity in Copywriting
If relevance is how you connect with your reader, curiosity is how you turn that connection into interest. Think of curiosity as the psychological glue that keeps your reader's attention on the page or keeps them tuned into your message, whether it's written, video, or audio.
That's why curiosity is the second of the 10 Persuasive Copywriting Techniques. It's the bridge between the first technique (relevance) and the others. Curiosity in copywriting can be defined as "the expectation of a relevant and valuable discovery."
 
The Role of Curiosity in Copywriting
When your reader expects to discover something relevant and valuable in your message, they're far more likely to stay engaged. Some marketers call this "holding their attention," but curiosity does more than that—it creates a desire to satisfy a mental itch.
In today's world, where distractions are everywhere, even an interested reader can be pulled away. Curiosity is how you ensure they will want to come back to your message to satisfy their need to know more. Using curiosity effectively is tricky, but it's a skill worth mastering.
 
Two Types of Curiosity in Copywriting
1.	High-Value Curiosity
2.	Low-Value Curiosity
Low-value curiosity appeals to the base desire for novelty or intrigue but doesn’t offer any real promise of value. This is common in clickbait and tabloid headlines. It may capture a click, but it won’t hold interest for long.
Example: "Weird Trick for Losing Belly Fat"
In contrast, high-value curiosity leverages both relevance and the expectation of a valuable discovery. It builds trust by promising the reader that the payoff will be worth it.
Example: "How I Closed a $100,000 SEO Client with This One Tactic"
 
Examples of Curiosity in Copywriting
The previous technique introduced relevance. Now, we will build on that by layering in high-value curiosity to hold the reader's attention.
 
Curiosity in Copywriting: Example #1
“What’s With this pinching pain in my right elbow?”
David loved golf but started feeling a sharp pain in his elbow. A year later, he had a choice: spend $10,000 on surgery or give up golf forever.
Curious yet? By using relevance (golf, elbow pain) and introducing a decision, we encourage the reader to wonder, "What happened to David?"
 
Curiosity in Copywriting: Example #2
“How I Caught my Husband in His Second Affair”
After forgiving her husband once, she starts noticing suspicious late-night texts. Dr. Ken Hitchens, a 30-year marriage counselor, says, "A man's second affair is different. He usually does two things differently. Once you know what they are, you'll know whether he's cheating."
This example pulls the reader in with a relevant problem and then introduces curiosity with the promise of a valuable insight.
 
How to Apply Curiosity in Copywriting
To use curiosity effectively:
1.	Start with Relevance: Your curiosity must relate to the reader’s existing concerns.
2.	Ask the Right Question: What is the most eye-opening thing you can reveal about their problem?
3.	Create Anticipation: Give them enough to be curious but hold back the full reveal to keep them reading.
4.	Deliver High Value: Ensure the payoff is significant and useful.
 
Mastering Curiosity in Copywriting
When mastered, curiosity becomes a powerful tool to engage readers and guide them through your message. To succeed, focus on high-value curiosity—one that both grabs attention and holds it by promising a meaningful discovery.
Technique #3: Hope in Copywriting
Article #3 from the series, 10 Persuasive Copywriting Techniques

Hope in Copywriting
If relevance is how you connect with your reader, and curiosity is how you turn that connection into interest, hope is how you transform your reader’s interest into a burning desire. Think of hope as the fuel that amplifies interest until your reader can almost feel the desired benefits in their nervous system.
I refer to this as creating a "synthetic experience." A synthetic experience happens when your reader imagines the benefits of your product or service so vividly that it changes their brain chemistry (more on this later). This feeling is what propels your reader from simply being interested to eagerly anticipating the outcome of your offer.
 
The Role of Hope in Copywriting
Hope in copywriting is defined as “the anticipation of a relevant and valuable experience.” The key term here is anticipation—your reader should expect to experience the benefits of your product or service and become emotionally involved with that expectation.
Many marketing efforts generate interest but fail to convert it into action because they lack hope. Think about this:
•	How many qualified prospects see your ad but never respond?
•	How many visitors land on your website, only to leave without taking action?
•	How many subscribers on your email list never open your emails?
At some point, these individuals were interested, but they lost the anticipation of experiencing the value your product offers. This is where hope comes in—keeping them emotionally involved with the anticipated benefits.
 
Examples of Hope in Copywriting
In previous articles, we covered relevance and curiosity. Now, let's build on those concepts and explore how to create hope by focusing on two aspects:
•	Semantic Hope: Your reader’s internal dialogue.
•	Emotional Hope: The emotional frame of that dialogue.
Hope is centered around the benefits your product or service offers. What does your reader think and feel when they imagine themselves using your product? Let’s look at an example.
 
Hope in Copywriting: Example #1
Let’s revisit our amateur bodybuilder from previous examples. He wants to gain 20 pounds of muscle, and here’s what he might be saying to himself:
•	“I want a bigger chest and arms.”
•	“I want to be one of the biggest guys at my gym.”
•	“I want people to notice when I take off my shirt.”
These thoughts represent semantic hope—clear expressions of the reader’s goals. But for hope to truly spark desire, we need to add emotional depth. What is this bodybuilder feeling as he imagines his future self? Perhaps pride, excitement, and validation.
Let’s look at how we might write copy to reflect that emotional frame:
 
How I Went from Being a Hard-Gainer to One of the Biggest Guys at My Gym
[RELEVANCE]
I once idolized the big guys at my gym—the ones with Jason Momoan pecs, shoulders like boulders, and veins popping from their arms like garden hoses. I’d stare in envy, thinking:
“That guy has to be on the juice.”
Five years of killing myself in the gym only gained me 10 pounds of muscle.
[HOPE]
But today, I’m one of the biggest guys at the gym. Now, I’m the one people stare at when I take off my shirt.
I get questions from the “skinny guys” asking me:
•	“What supplements are you using?”
•	“What’s your workout routine?”
•	“How can I build arms like yours?”
Think this couldn’t happen to you? You won’t think so for long. [CURIOSITY]
Here’s the first thing you need to know about getting big...
 
This example turns our reader’s desires into hope. The internal dialogue about building muscle becomes tangible with the emotional fuel of pride and validation. We’ve transformed curiosity into eager anticipation, making the reader desire the outcome even more.
 
Hope in Copywriting: Example #2
Next, let’s use a different buyer persona—a mid-thirties mom wanting to lose weight after having her second child. Here’s what she might be thinking:
•	“I just want to feel good again.”
•	“I want to fit into my favorite jeans.”
•	“I want to eat dessert without guilt.”
These are expressions of semantic hope. But to turn this into a compelling message, we need to layer in the emotions—happiness, confidence, and relief.
 
I Just Wanted to Feel Good Again
[HOPE]
Nellie just wanted to feel good again. She didn’t need to fit into size four jeans or run marathons.
“I just want to fit into my size eight jeans and enjoy dessert without feeling guilty,” she said as she pulled a pair of jeans from her closet.
If you’re a mom of two or three who’s tired of fad diets and just wants to feel happy again, you’ll be inspired by Nellie’s story. One year ago, she was a size 14. Today, she’s a size 7—and happier than ever.
[RELEVANCE]
“I was tired of starving myself and feeling guilty about having a piece of cheesecake,” Nellie said. “I tried everything. Nothing worked. [HOPE] Then, I discovered something that changed my life forever.”
 
In this case, the reader’s semantic hope (losing weight, fitting into jeans) is enhanced by emotional hope (feeling happy, free from guilt). We’ve tapped into the deeper emotional needs, like happiness and comfort, rather than focusing on superficial benefits.
 
How to Apply Hope in Copywriting
To master hope in copywriting, you need to:
1.	Define Your Buyer Persona.
2.	Envision Their Ideal Day.
o	What does life look like after using your product or service?
3.	Understand Their Internal Dialogue.
o	What do they think when they imagine those benefits?
4.	Identify the Emotional Frame of Their Desires.
o	What emotions accompany their internal dialogue?
By defining these aspects, you can shape your copy to resonate deeply with both the semantic and emotional hopes of your audience.
 
Mastering Hope in Copywriting
Remember, hope in copywriting isn’t just about showing the benefits of your product—it’s about making your reader feel those benefits as vividly as if they were already experiencing them. To do this, you need to dive into their internal dialogue and their emotional needs.
When done right, hope becomes the fuel that propels your reader from mere interest to active desire, bridging the gap between curiosity and action.
 
Next Step: Turn Hope into Urgency
In the next article, we’ll explore how to turn this desire into urgency, the final push that compels readers to act on their hope.

Rapport in Copywriting (Generic Version)
The Role of Rapport in Copywriting
If relevance is how you connect with your reader, and curiosity is how you turn that connection into interest, and hope is how you turn that interest into desire, rapport is how you turn that desire into motivation.
Rapport is about creating a bond between you and your reader, dissolving their fears and objections, and positioning yourself as someone they can trust. Without trust, even the most compelling offer will fall flat. Trust comes from rapport, which I define as a relationship built on “mutual trust or emotional affinity.”
Affinity is the key here. When your reader feels like they share something in common with you, they’re more likely to trust your message. This could be shared values, experiences, or even speech patterns. This phenomenon is grounded in psychology, specifically the “mere liking effect,” which shows that people tend to trust those who resemble them in some way.
The Secret of Rapport
People trust people who are like them. Rapport, in this context, is built when your reader feels a natural affinity with you or the person in your story. Once you establish rapport, your reader will be more inclined to believe your claims, accept your advice, and take action on your offer.
Your goal is to create a sense of “this person is like me,” or “this person understands me.” It’s important to note that rapport is more about how your reader feels than what they logically think. They don’t need a rational explanation to trust you; they simply need to feel a connection.
Examples of Rapport in Copywriting
Let’s build on some earlier examples of copywriting and see how rapport can be integrated.
Example #1: The Hard-gainer Bodybuilder
[RELEVANCE >] “I once idolized the big guys at my gym. They had muscles like football helmets and biceps with veins like garden hoses. Every day, I watched them effortlessly lifting weights that I couldn’t dream of picking up.” [< RELEVANCE]
[HOPE >] “Today, I’m one of the biggest guys at the gym. I don’t just look strong; I feel confident when I walk into the room. I know people are watching and wondering what my secret is.” [< HOPE]
[CURIOSITY >] “What if I told you that I didn’t win the genetic lottery? I used to be just like you, struggling to put on muscle and embarrassed to take my shirt off in front of others.” [< CURIOSITY]
[RAPPORT >] “Like you, I was frustrated. I missed out on a lot of things because I didn’t have the body I wanted. Beach trips with my friends? Forget about it. I didn’t want anyone to see me with my shirt off. I spent years lifting weights and eating like a horse, just to gain a few pounds of muscle. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong or that I was just destined to be ‘the skinny guy’ forever. Sound familiar?” [< RAPPORT]
This example builds rapport by showing the reader that the writer has been where they are. The reader recognizes their own struggles in the writer’s story and feels a connection. This emotional affinity makes it easier for the reader to trust what comes next.
Example #2: The Post-Pregnancy Weight Loss Journey
[HOPE >] “Nellie just wanted to fit into her size 8 jeans again. She didn’t need to run a marathon or fit into a size 2. She just wanted to feel good about herself when she looked in the mirror.” [< HOPE]
[RELEVANCE >] “Like many moms, she was tired of fad diets and feeling guilty every time she ate a slice of cake. No matter what she tried, the weight just wouldn’t come off.” [< RELEVANCE]
[RAPPORT >] “Your second pregnancy was different, wasn’t it? You were more tired, you gained weight faster, and it’s been harder to lose. You’re not alone. Most women don’t know why their second pregnancy is so different, and Nellie didn’t either. Like you, she tried every diet and workout routine she could find, but nothing worked. That’s when she learned a secret that changed everything…” [< RAPPORT]
This example builds rapport by acknowledging the specific struggles of a mom after a second pregnancy. It uses shared experiences to create a bond between the reader and Nellie, the story’s protagonist. The reader feels understood, and that makes them more likely to trust the solution being offered.
How to Apply Rapport in Copywriting
The key to mastering rapport in copywriting is knowing your reader deeply—what are their struggles, their desires, and their experiences? You must tap into these elements to create a connection. Here are the primary data points to focus on when building rapport:
1.	Demographic Data: Who are they? (Age, gender, income level, occupation)
2.	Psychographic Data: What are their values, fears, and desires?
3.	Dog Whistle Language: What are the specific terms, slang, or cultural references that resonate with them?
4.	Stage of Awareness: Where are they in their journey? Are they aware of the solution, or are they just learning about it?
Use these data points to craft a message that sounds like it’s coming from someone who understands your reader intimately. Make them feel like they’re not just another face in the crowd but that you’re speaking directly to them.
Technique #5: Storytelling in Copywriting
Storytelling in Copywriting
In the first four articles of this series, we discussed how to turn attention into interest, interest into desire, and desire into motivation. Now, we’ll explore storytelling, a powerful method to deepen engagement and create a lasting connection with your audience.
Storytelling is one of the most effective techniques in persuasive copywriting. Done right, it can be the medium through which you apply other persuasive techniques, such as relevance, curiosity, and hope. A well-crafted story draws your reader in, allowing them to experience the benefits of your product or service through the narrative.
The Role of Storytelling in Copywriting
Storytelling creates a "synthetic experience" for your reader—a vivid, emotional journey that engages them on a sensory level. Through storytelling, you can connect with your audience in a way that feels genuine and human, rather than transactional. By telling a story that your readers can insert themselves into, you not only capture their attention, but you also tap into their emotions and imagination.
Think of storytelling as a tool to give your reader a glimpse of the solution you’re offering, by creating a world where they already experience the benefits of your product or service. This immersive experience is what makes storytelling so effective. Your reader should feel as though they are a part of the narrative, as if the solution is already theirs, just waiting to be realized.
Examples of Storytelling in Copywriting
Example #1:
Imagine a customer suffering from chronic back pain. They’ve tried many solutions, from physical therapy to medication, but nothing has worked. They find your blog post:
 
“How I Finally Overcame My Chronic Back Pain”
[STORYTELLING >] I’ll never forget the day I was finally able to get out of bed without wincing in pain. For years, my mornings had been a painful reminder of my back problems. I tried everything: physical therapy, stretching routines, painkillers, even meditation. But nothing seemed to work.
One day, a friend recommended something I hadn’t considered: ergonomic furniture. I was skeptical at first, but after using an ergonomic chair and standing desk for a few weeks, the change was undeniable. For the first time in years, I could sit for hours without discomfort and sleep through the night without waking up in pain.
[< STORYTELLING]
 
This story pulls the reader in by mirroring their own struggle. The reader can imagine themselves as the person in the story, and the solution—ergonomic furniture—becomes something they want to explore because it is already embedded in a narrative of success.
Example #2:
In this example, the story focuses on a customer who has transformed their life through fitness coaching:
 
“From Overweight to Fit: My Journey to a Healthier Life”
[STORYTELLING >] I used to dread looking in the mirror. For years, I ignored the growing weight and the feeling of sluggishness that came with it. I knew something had to change, but I didn’t know where to start.
Then, I signed up for a fitness coaching program. It wasn’t easy at first—early mornings, strict meal plans, and pushing through intense workouts. But week by week, I saw the weight drop and my energy levels rise. After six months, I looked in the mirror and hardly recognized myself. The person staring back wasn’t just thinner; they were stronger, healthier, and more confident.
[< STORYTELLING]
 
This example uses storytelling to paint a clear picture of the transformation the customer experienced. The reader can visualize the process, feel the struggles, and share the sense of achievement at the end. This emotional journey helps build a connection between the reader and the solution offered.
How to Apply Storytelling in Copywriting
1.	Start with Relevance: Your story should always start by connecting with the reader’s current problem or situation. The reader needs to see themselves in the story to feel emotionally engaged.
2.	Make It Relatable: Use real-world examples or scenarios that match your audience's life. The more your reader can identify with the characters or situations, the more impactful the story will be.
3.	Build a Narrative Arc: Every story needs a beginning, middle, and end. Start with the problem, introduce the solution, and conclude with the transformation.
4.	Engage the Senses: Use vivid, descriptive language to paint a mental picture. The more your reader can “see” and “feel” the story, the stronger their connection to it will be.
5.	Lead to Action: Every story should have a clear takeaway or lesson that leads the reader to want to act. This could be clicking a link, purchasing a product, or signing up for more information.
Mastering Storytelling in Copywriting
The secret to mastering storytelling in copywriting is practicing how to weave your narrative into a relevant and engaging message. Storytelling is about creating a journey for your reader—one where they can visualize themselves experiencing the benefits of your product or service. By doing this, you can make your offer irresistible, not just because of the product, but because of the story it tells and the emotions it evokes.
Technique #6: Hypnotic Copywriting
Hypnotic Copywriting: a style of writing that engages the emotions of the reader by using words, phrases, and descriptions that appeal to one or more of the five senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell).
 
In the first four articles, we discussed how to turn attention into interest, interest into desire, and desire into urgency. As mentioned before, the final techniques focus on turning urgency into action. Hypnotic copywriting is the sixth technique, focusing on creating a mental "trance" that immerses your reader into a synthetic experience—a powerful method of engaging emotions and making your product or service irresistible.
The Role of Hypnotic Copywriting
Hypnotic copywriting is about creating what I call a synthetic experience—a vivid and engaging scenario in the reader’s imagination that feels so real it alters their physical and emotional state. In other words, your writing can create physiological responses in the reader’s nervous system simply by describing a scene or an experience using sensory words.
Let’s try a quick exercise. Close your eyes and imagine your favorite dish being served to you at your favorite restaurant. The aroma fills your nose as you breathe in deeply. You pick up your fork, and the moment it touches your mouth, the flavors burst—rich, satisfying, with the perfect temperature and texture. You can almost taste it, can’t you?
This is the power of hypnotic copywriting. The scenario I described wasn’t real, but your body and mind responded to it as though it was. Your heart rate may have quickened, and your mouth may have started watering. This is how sensory details engage your reader’s senses, making the experience vivid, personal, and emotionally engaging.
The Goal: Use sensory words and descriptions that appeal to sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell to create a mental movie that makes your product feel real and irresistible.
Examples of Hypnotic Copywriting
Let's dive into a few examples, one for each of the five senses, and break down how they engage readers through sensory language.
 
Example #1: Sight Words
Imagine our reader is considering a vacation. We need to appeal to their visual senses to paint a picture they can’t resist:
 
"Picture This…"
You step onto your private balcony, and endless miles of blue-green ocean stretch out before you. Beams of sunlight reflect off the clear, turquoise water, and you can see schools of colorful fish swimming just beneath the surface. The golden sand glistens, and palm trees sway in the breeze as waves lap gently at the shore. This is your tropical paradise.
 
Notice how we engage the reader’s sight with descriptions like "blue-green ocean," "turquoise water," and "golden sand." By inviting the reader to "Picture this…", we help them visualize the scene, which brings the vacation closer to reality in their minds.
 
Example #2: Sound Words
Imagine that the product is a high-end luxury car, and we want to emphasize the auditory experience of driving it:
 
"Listen Closely…"
As you press the pedal, you hear the soft growl of the V8 engine roaring to life. The tires hum smoothly against the pavement as the wind whistles softly past the windows. The sound system fills the cabin with the crystal-clear tones of your favorite song, and everything else fades into the background. It’s just you, the road, and the music.
 
In this example, we focus on the sounds: the "soft growl" of the engine, the "hum" of the tires, and the music filling the car. These sensory details create an immersive auditory experience that makes the reader imagine themselves in the driver’s seat.
 
Example #3: Touch Words
Now, let’s imagine a product like a leather jacket, where we want to emphasize how it feels:
 
"Feel This…"
Slide your arms into the buttery soft leather sleeves, and instantly, the cool material starts to warm against your skin. The snug fit feels like it was made just for you. As you zip it up, the smooth, thick leather molds perfectly to your body, offering warmth, comfort, and confidence with every movement.
 
This example focuses on touch: the "buttery soft leather," the jacket warming against the skin, and the feel of it molding to the body. These tactile descriptions invite the reader to imagine what wearing the jacket feels like, enhancing the appeal.
 
Example #4: Taste Words
Now, let’s create a scenario for a gourmet meal delivery service:
 
"Now Take a Bite…"
Sink your teeth into a juicy, perfectly seasoned filet mignon, cooked just the way you like it. The flavors explode in your mouth—the richness of the beef, the earthy tang of rosemary, and the subtle heat of black pepper. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables, every bite is a symphony of flavor.
 
Here, we use taste words: "juicy," "richness of the beef," "earthy tang of rosemary." These descriptions make the reader imagine the food, sparking a craving that only ordering the meal can satisfy.
 
Example #5: Smell Words
Imagine we’re selling scented candles, and we want to convey their sensory appeal:
 
"Breathe it In…"
As soon as you light the candle, the scent of fresh lavender and vanilla fills the air. It’s calming, warm, and soothing, like a gentle embrace at the end of a long day. The soft, floral notes of the lavender mix with the rich sweetness of vanilla, creating a fragrant haven of relaxation.
 
This example emphasizes smell: "fresh lavender," "rich sweetness of vanilla." These words bring the fragrance to life in the reader’s mind, creating a craving for the peaceful, aromatic environment the candle provides.
 
How to Apply Hypnotic Copywriting
1.	Engage the Senses: Always aim to evoke at least one of the five senses—sight, sound, touch, taste, or smell. The more senses you engage, the more immersive the experience will be.
2.	Use Vivid, Specific Language: Abstract phrases like "comfortable" or "beautiful" don’t engage the imagination. Use vivid language that makes your reader feel, hear, or taste what you’re describing.
3.	Create a Mental Movie: Your goal is to make the reader feel like they are experiencing your product in real-time. This makes your offer more appealing, creating a deep emotional connection.
4.	Contrast with Reality: Use dissonance by contrasting the imagined experience with the reader’s current reality. This makes the imagined scenario even more desirable, prompting them to take action.
 
Mastering Hypnotic Copywriting
The key to mastering hypnotic copywriting is to practice using sensory words in your writing. Start by building a list of words that appeal to sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Then, begin using them to create vivid experiences that immerse your reader in the benefits of your product or service.
The second step is using these words to move the reader down the Ladder of Abstraction, from conceptual ideas to sensory engagement. Mastering this process will elevate your writing, making it more engaging, memorable, and persuasive.
##7 Generic Emotional Copywriting Version
Emotional Copywriting
Emotional copywriting is a powerful technique that taps into the core emotions driving human behavior—whether it’s the need for validation, excitement, or security.

1.	Identify the Core Emotional Need
Is your audience seeking validation, excitement, or security? Start by identifying which emotional need is most relevant to your product or service, and then tailor your copy to address that need.
2.	Use Contrast
Emotional copywriting is effective when it creates a strong contrast between the pain of the current state (e.g., feeling unfulfilled, bored, or unsafe) and the relief or joy the product will bring (e.g., confidence, excitement, or security).
3.	Leverage Sensory Language
To create a vivid emotional experience, use sensory words and descriptions that make the reader feel what it would be like to resolve their unmet needs with your product. This not only helps build a connection but also makes the copy more persuasive.
4.	Create Urgency
Once you’ve highlighted the emotional contrast, drive urgency by showing the consequences of inaction. What happens if they continue feeling bored, insecure, or inadequate? By framing the solution as immediate and necessary, you push the reader toward taking action now.
 
Mastering Emotional Copywriting
The secret to mastering emotional copywriting is understanding how to navigate between emotions and logic. Once you’ve captured your reader’s attention with an emotional appeal, you’ll need to provide logical justification for their decision. Start by:
1.	Studying Your Audience
Use Buyer Persona research to understand your audience’s emotional needs, fears, and desires. This will help you craft copy that speaks directly to their internal struggles.
2.	Balancing Emotion and Logic
While emotions drive decisions, logic justifies them. After making an emotional appeal, support it with facts, statistics, or testimonials to make the reader feel confident in their choice.
3.	Practice and Refine
Like any writing technique, emotional copywriting takes practice. Experiment with different emotional contrasts, and refine your approach based on what resonates most with your audience.
##8 Suspense in Copywriting
The Role of Suspense in Copywriting
Suspense in copywriting, or “breadcrumbing,” as it is often called, is about creating anticipation that drives your reader to the next line—and the next, until the action you want them to take feels irresistible. At its core, suspense is the delayed satisfaction of curiosity. Your job is to build enough intrigue to keep them reading, while also providing small but meaningful clues that assure them the payoff will be worth it.
Breadcrumbing uses unresolved questions or tension to keep the reader hooked, while carefully balancing resolution and new anticipations. The power of suspense lies not only in holding your reader’s attention but in guiding that attention toward action. By leaving just enough unanswered, you build momentum until your final call to action feels inevitable.
 
Examples of Suspense in Copywriting
Example 1: Fitness Program (Suspense + Breadcrumbs)
Headline: The Secret to Gaining Muscle Faster
Most people at the gym think they know the secret to building muscle: hours of grueling workouts, heavy weights, and endless protein shakes. But what if I told you the real key has nothing to do with how long you train or how much you lift?
It started with a minor tweak in my routine—something so simple I couldn’t believe it wasn’t common knowledge. At first, the changes were small—barely noticeable, but after the first week, my muscles began to respond like never before. By the third week, I had gained more muscle than I had in three months of traditional training.
Sound too good to be true? I thought so too—until I discovered the scientific reason behind it...
What I found changed my entire approach to working out. It wasn’t just about pushing harder; it was about optimizing my body’s natural ability to grow. And the best part? This secret works no matter your genetics.
Stay with me, and I’ll explain exactly what this technique is and why it works better than any routine you've tried before.
 
Example 2: Travel Experience (Suspense + Emotional Engagement)
Headline: What’s Waiting for You in the Hidden Corners of the World?
You’ve been dreaming of a vacation that’s more than just another beach holiday. You want an adventure—a journey into the unknown. But what if I told you there are places so remote, so untouched by tourism, that stepping foot there feels like traveling back in time?
It’s not on any map you’ve seen. It’s not advertised in glossy brochures. This is a place known only to a few, a destination that offers breathtaking landscapes and experiences beyond your imagination.
I know what you’re thinking: How do I get there? What makes this place so special?
Before I tell you, let me paint a picture: imagine walking through ancient ruins with no crowds, exploring jungles where you’re the only traveler for miles, and standing on cliffs overlooking crystal-clear waters that haven’t changed in centuries. You’ll experience it all—if you’re willing to step off the beaten path and into the extraordinary.
Ready to discover this hidden paradise? I’ll reveal its exact location and how you can get there in just a moment.
 
How to Apply Suspense in Copywriting
Applying suspense in copywriting is about guiding your reader’s curiosity. Here’s how you can do it:
1.	Ask What Your Reader Is Thinking
o	Predict your reader’s questions or doubts at each step. What might they be wondering at this point in your copy? Address those thoughts, but only give partial answers, teasing more information just ahead.
2.	Set an Expectation
o	Create curiosity by setting up a promise or an unexpected twist. What is the one thing they need to know to fulfill their desire or avoid a negative outcome?
3.	Deliver Breadcrumbs of Information
o	Withhold full resolution until the end, offering just enough details to maintain the reader’s trust while feeding their curiosity. As you lead them forward, give hints that build the value of your final offer or solution.
 
Mastering Suspense in Copywriting
Mastering suspense requires balancing tension and resolution. You need to keep readers hooked without frustrating them or leading them to feel strung along. The key is to understand your audience’s desires, fears, and motivations, and craft a narrative that speaks directly to those emotions.
Breadcrumbing, when done effectively, creates a powerful sense of forward momentum, making readers eager to learn more and excited to act when the time comes. But timing is critical—too much suspense can turn into annoyance, while too little leaves the reader disengaged.
##9. Generic Positioning in Copywriting Example
Positioning in Copywriting
Positioning in copywriting is a technique that highlights how your product or service is uniquely suited to your target market, while differentiating it from the competition. It answers the questions, “Why should I trust this product?” and “Will it work for me?”
The key to effective positioning lies in demonstrating:
1.	Relevance – Showing that your product is the best solution for someone like your target customer.
2.	Superiority – Convincing your reader that your product delivers better results than competing solutions.
3.	Uniqueness – Proving that your product offers something distinct that they cannot find elsewhere.
The Role of Positioning in Copywriting
Positioning helps to turn urgency into action, particularly for prospects who are at Stage #3 of the Buyer’s Journey. At this stage, they are aware of their problem and are now comparing products or services to find the best fit. Proper positioning addresses both the functional aspects (e.g., will it solve my problem?) and emotional aspects (e.g., is this the right choice for me?).
 
Positioning in Copywriting: Example #1 (Relevance)
For positioning to be relevant, it must resonate with the target customer’s needs, lifestyle, and preferences. Imagine you are targeting health-conscious customers who are tired of dealing with high-sugar snack bars. Here’s how you might position a natural, low-sugar snack:
 
"The Best Low-Sugar Snack for Active Lifestyles"
If you're active and care about what you eat, finding the right snack can be tough. Most "healthy" snacks are loaded with hidden sugars, causing energy crashes that disrupt your day. That's why our snack bars are designed specifically for people like you—those who value natural ingredients without the sugar overload.
We’ve created our low-sugar snack bars with your active lifestyle in mind. Whether you’re fueling up for a workout or need a quick snack on the go, our bars deliver long-lasting energy without the sugar crash.
 
Positioning in Copywriting: Example #2 (Superiority)
Superiority is all about demonstrating why your product or service is better than the alternatives. It involves showing tangible results and benefits. Here’s how you could position a skincare product for those with sensitive skin:
 
"Proven Skincare for Sensitive Skin, Recommended by Dermatologists"
When it comes to sensitive skin, not all skincare products are created equal. You’ve probably tried countless products, only to experience irritation or redness. Our formula is not only all-natural but has been clinically tested and recommended by dermatologists for its calming, nourishing effects.
Our customers have reported a 95% improvement in skin sensitivity within the first month. Try it risk-free with our satisfaction guarantee—if it doesn’t work for you, we’ll refund your purchase.
 
Positioning in Copywriting: Example #3 (Uniqueness)
Uniqueness is crucial for standing out in a crowded market. Here’s an example of how you could position a patented piece of fitness equipment:
 
"The Only Patented Fitness Device That Gives You a Full-Body Workout in 15 Minutes"
While other fitness tools promise results, our patented design is the only one on the market that delivers a full-body workout in just 15 minutes. The secret lies in our innovative resistance technology, which targets every major muscle group with minimal time commitment.
Unlike other devices, which require long training sessions, our equipment helps you achieve maximum results in the shortest time possible. That’s why fitness professionals and busy people around the world rely on it to stay in shape.
 
How to Apply Positioning in Copywriting
1.	Relevance: Understand your target audience, their pain points, and their preferences. Speak directly to their concerns, showing that your product is made for someone like them.
2.	Superiority: Provide clear evidence of your product’s effectiveness. Share customer testimonials, expert reviews, and real-world results that show how your product works better than the competition.
3.	Uniqueness: Highlight what makes your product or service truly different. Is it a patent? A unique formula? A specific feature that others can’t replicate? This is your Unique Selling Proposition (USP).
Mastering positioning in copywriting means aligning these three pillars to build trust, reduce doubts, and ultimately, lead your prospects to take action.
##10.  Technique #10: Urgency in Copywriting
Article #10 (Final) from the series, 10 Persuasive Copywriting Techniques
Topics Covered in This Article
•	The Role of Urgency in Copywriting
•	Examples of Urgency in Copywriting
•	How to Apply Urgency in Copywriting
•	Mastering Urgency in Copywriting
 
Urgency in Copywriting
There are two ways to create urgency in copywriting: external pressure and internal pressure. External pressure is simpler and involves things like limited-time offers. Internal pressure, on the other hand, is more nuanced but far more powerful. In fact, when done correctly, internal pressure amplifies the effectiveness of any limited-time offer.
 
The Role of Urgency in Copywriting
Urgency in copywriting is rooted in a psychological phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance occurs when someone holds conflicting beliefs or behaves in ways that are inconsistent with their values. This psychological discomfort pushes people to resolve the conflict—either by changing their behavior or rationalizing their current behavior to align with their beliefs.
When applied to copywriting, creating urgency means contrasting your reader’s present situation (their pain or frustration) with the benefits your product or service offers. By making this contrast clear and powerful, you push the reader to make a decision that aligns their actions with their desires or values.
Your goal is to make the reader feel like they have two options:
1.	Take action and solve the problem.
2.	Sit in discomfort, rationalizing inaction.
If you do this well, you create a sense of urgency that drives conversions.
 
Examples of Urgency in Copywriting
To create urgency, you need to contrast the positive emotions associated with solving a problem with the negative emotions that arise from staying stuck in the same situation.
Here are three examples of how urgency can be created, each one catering to a different emotional need.
 
Urgency in Copywriting: Example #1 (Validation)
Scenario: The reader is a freelance graphic designer who struggles to attract high-paying clients and is stuck in low-paying gigs. They want to feel valued and respected for their work.
 
Which Designer Do You Want to Be?
In the world of design, there are creators who are recognized, sought after, and paid handsomely. [CONTRAST >]And then, there are the ones who remain stuck doing small jobs for clients who don’t appreciate their creativity. They never get the recognition or the pay they deserve.[< CONTRAST]
The choice is yours. [CONTRAST WITH HOPE >]You can either continue taking on low-paying gigs, feeling undervalued, or you can break out and become the kind of designer everyone is talking about—the one whose work commands respect and premium prices.[< CONTRAST WITH HOPE]
[REVISITING PRESENT PAIN >]You’ve already spent years waiting for that breakthrough client or that next big opportunity. But deep down, you know that if you don’t make a change now, you’ll still be waiting a year from now.[< REVISITING PRESENT PAIN]
This program was created specifically for designers like you—those ready to step up and claim the recognition they’ve worked so hard for. The only question left is: Will you take that step today, or stay stuck where you are?
 
Urgency in Copywriting: Example #2 (Excitement)
Scenario: The reader is a professional looking for a change. They want to transition into a more exciting and fulfilling career but are nervous about taking the first step.
 
Isn’t It Time to Start Living the Life You’ve Dreamed Of?
You’ve thought about it countless times. [BOREDOM >]You’ve sat in meetings, stared out the window, and wondered what it would be like to wake up excited about your day, your work, your life.[< BOREDOM]
Now, imagine this: [EXCITEMENT >]waking up to a career you love, one where every day feels like an opportunity to do something great, to create, and to make an impact.[< EXCITEMENT]
[CONTRAST WITH HOPE >]The freedom, the energy, the passion—those are all within reach, but only if you take action now. You can either continue wishing for change or you can join this program and start creating it.[< CONTRAST WITH HOPE]
[REVISITING PRESENT PAIN >]The longer you wait, the further away that dream feels. The clock is ticking, and every day you don’t take action is a day lost.[< REVISITING PRESENT PAIN]
Isn’t it time to make the leap?
 
Urgency in Copywriting: Example #3 (Security)
Scenario: The reader is a small business owner who has been struggling to maintain steady revenue. They want security and confidence in their financial future.
 
Take Control of Your Business’s Future
Right now, your business is struggling to stay consistent. [FEAR >]You know the pain of seeing revenue drop, worrying if the next client will come through. It’s exhausting, and it’s keeping you up at night.[< FEAR]
Imagine this instead: [SECURITY >]your business running like a well-oiled machine. You have a steady stream of clients, predictable revenue, and a clear plan for growth.[< SECURITY]
[CONTRAST WITH HOPE >]You can either keep wondering how you’ll make it through the next quarter, or you can take control of your business’s future by joining this program. This is the path to the stability you crave.[< CONTRAST WITH HOPE]
[REVISITING PRESENT PAIN >]You’ve already spent months (maybe years) on the rollercoaster of unpredictable revenue. Don’t let another year go by without making the changes you need to secure your business’s future.[< REVISITING PRESENT PAIN]
The choice is yours: continue living with the fear of uncertainty, or take control today.
 
How to Apply Urgency in Copywriting
To apply urgency in your copy, follow this process:
1.	Understand Your Buyer Persona: Identify their emotional needs and pain points.
2.	Create Contrast: Show them the stark difference between their current reality and the reality your product or service offers.
3.	Revisit Present Pain: Remind them of the pain they’re currently experiencing and how staying where they are will only prolong it.
4.	Use Hope and Fear: Appeal to their desire for a better future (hope) and their fear of staying stuck (pain).
 
Mastering Urgency in Copywriting
The key to mastering urgency in copywriting is to stop focusing on selling products and services and start focusing on selling experiences. You want your reader to feel the change that your product or service can create in their life.
The emotions you stir in your copy should last long after they’ve seen your message. This ensures that your product stays in their mind and becomes something they can’t stop thinking about—until they take action.
When you master urgency in copywriting, you create an internal pressure so powerful that the only way for your reader to relie#ve it is to make a decision and buy.
##11. Technique #11: Dan S. Kennedy on Dog Whistle Marketing (Generic Version)
Topics Covered in This Article
•	The Least Understood Truth in Copywriting
•	Dog Whistle Language in Content Marketing
•	Examples of Dog Whistle Language
•	The Ethics of Dog Whistle Marketing
 
The Dog Whistle You Don’t Hear
Dan Kennedy’s Dog Whistle Marketing technique reveals one of the most powerful yet underutilized methods of persuasive copywriting. It's the practice of using specific language that resonates deeply with a targeted audience, without being obvious to others. Much like a dog whistle, only those "tuned in" to the frequency will hear it, while it passes unnoticed by everyone else.
The key to Dog Whistle Marketing lies in understanding that different words, while seeming synonymous, evoke different responses depending on the audience. It’s not about replacing words with others from a thesaurus—it's about finding those phrases that speak directly to the values, concerns, and emotions of your ideal reader.
 
The Least Understood Truth in Copywriting
Kennedy emphasizes that “Different words that mean the same thing mean different things to different people.” This seemingly paradoxical idea is crucial for any effective copywriter. While some writers simply swap words to avoid repetition, Dog Whistle Marketing goes deeper. It’s about selecting words that carry unique emotional or cultural weight for a specific group.
This concept highlights the difference between casual word choice and truly strategic language use. A good copywriter doesn’t just write for anyone—they write for someone. They tailor their words to resonate with a specific audience on an emotional level.
 
Dog Whistle Language in Marketing
In marketing, Dog Whistle Language means crafting your message in a way that resonates powerfully with a specific group of people, while others might overlook it. It’s a tool to connect with your target audience’s internal beliefs, fears, or desires in a way that others don’t fully grasp.
For instance, when political figures use terms like “real Americans,” they’re not explicitly saying who doesn’t fit that category—but certain listeners instinctively know the message is for them. They recognize the subtle nuances that align with their beliefs.
Similarly, in copywriting, your goal is to craft messages that act as dog whistles for your ideal customers. It’s about using language that taps into their worldview, making them feel understood and drawn toward your product or service.
 
Examples of Dog Whistle Language
Imagine you’re writing for an investment firm targeting wealthy retirees. If you talk about "preserving wealth for future generations" and use phrases like "financial maturity" or "stability in uncertain times," those who have worked hard to accumulate wealth will resonate with the message. However, younger audiences might find these words irrelevant or dull.
Another example: If your target market is health-conscious individuals in their 50s, using words like "longevity," "well-being," and "natural solutions" can create that dog whistle effect. These words align with their lifestyle and values, even though to others, they may not have the same impact.
In all cases, the trick is to understand the values and emotions of your target audience and to use specific, nuanced language that speaks directly to them without alienating others.
 
The Ethics of Dog Whistle Marketing
While Dog Whistle Marketing can be highly effective, it must be used ethically. The goal isn’t to deceive or manipulate people but to speak to them in a way that aligns with their needs and beliefs. When used properly, Dog Whistle Marketing builds trust and fosters a deeper connection between the brand and the consumer.
Ethically, this technique should never be used to divide or exploit insecurities. Instead, it should create a sense of shared understanding, aligning the product or service with the core values of the target audience. Successful copywriters respect the audience and use Dog Whistle Language as a way to build rapport, not to manipulate.
 
In conclusion, Dog Whistle Marketing is about writing copy that resonates with a specific group’s values, experiences, and emotions. By carefully selecting language that speaks directly to them, you create a powerful bond that others may not even notice. The key is to understand your audience deeply, select your words carefully, and always use this technique with integrity.
