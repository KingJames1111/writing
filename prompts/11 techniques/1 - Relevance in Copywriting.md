Writing Technique #1: Relevance in Copywriting
Purpose:
Relevance is the cornerstone of effective copywriting, where the goal is to connect directly with the reader's current thoughts and emotional state. Relevance allows the writer to align the message with the reader's internal dialogue and emotional framework, creating a strong, empathetic connection.

1. The Role of Relevance in Copywriting
We live in a society saturated with marketing messages. As such, human attention has become an economic commodity. For a message to resonate with readers, it must immediately connect with something they are already thinking about — their internal dialogue — or feeling emotionally.
The primary goal of relevance is to make this connection. A failure to be relevant results in wasted effort. This is called “Pick-Up Line Marketing,” where an attempt to grab attention is made without creating any meaningful connection. The reader may notice the message but is unlikely to engage.
Instead, we aim to step into the reader’s internal world by crafting messages that join the conversation already happening in their mind. This increases the likelihood of getting the reader to engage with the content and ultimately respond to the call to action.
 
2. Semantic and Emotional Relevance
Relevance can be broken down into two main categories:
1.	Semantic Relevance: This refers to matching the words and thoughts that are already part of the reader's internal dialogue. It answers the question, "What is the reader thinking about right now?"
	o	Example: A parent worried about a teenager might think, “She better not be with that boy she brought home last week!” Matching this internal dialogue captures the reader’s attention because it mirrors their exact concerns.
2.	Emotional Relevance: This goes deeper than semantic relevance, addressing the emotional context that drives the reader’s thoughts. It answers the question, "What is the reader feeling?"
	o	Example: That same parent might be feeling fear, frustration, or anxiety. If the message taps into these emotions, it becomes far more powerful because it not only mirrors their thoughts but also acknowledges their emotional state.
 
3. Examples of Relevance in Copywriting
Example 1: Semantic Relevance Imagine a reader who is an athlete and experiences recurring elbow pain. They’ve tried everything — from stretching to online remedies — and the pain persists. When this person sees a headline like:
"What’s With this pinching pain in my right elbow?"
They are likely to continue reading because it connects directly with their internal dialogue. It’s not clever or catchy for the sake of it; it’s highly relevant.
Example 2: Emotional Relevance Take a reader who is a 52-year-old man noticing swollen ankles. He might not realize that this could be linked to a more severe health issue. A headline like:
"Are Your Swollen Ankles a Warning of a Coming Heart Attack?"
Creates not only semantic relevance (it addresses his swollen ankles) but also emotional relevance (it taps into his fear and concern for his health). This drives engagement because it mirrors both his internal thoughts and emotional concerns.
 
4. How to Apply Relevance in Copywriting
To effectively apply relevance in copywriting, follow these steps:
1.	Define the Buyer Persona: Start by understanding who your reader is. What are their typical thoughts, fears, desires, and pain points?
2.	Understand Their Day: Map out a typical day for your reader. When and where does the problem you’re addressing occur in their life? How does this issue affect them daily?
3.	Identify Internal Dialogue: What are they thinking about the problem your product solves? Identify key phrases or thoughts that represent this internal dialogue.
4.	Tap Into Emotional Context: What emotions are behind their internal thoughts? Are they feeling frustrated, anxious, or hopeful? Use this to make the message emotionally resonant.
 
5. Mastering Relevance in Copywriting
Empathy is the key to mastering relevance. The more deeply you understand the problem your reader faces, the better you can connect with their thoughts and emotions.
When you gather insights about your reader, you can write in a way that not only captures their attention but also holds it, ensuring they engage with your message. By practicing relevance, you are well on your way to becoming an effective and empathetic copywriter who connects meaningfully with your audience.
 
Summary:
•	Semantic Relevance aligns your message with the reader’s thoughts.
•	Emotional Relevance resonates with their feelings.
•	Connecting with both ensures your message is powerful and compelling.
