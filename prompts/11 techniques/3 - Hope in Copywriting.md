Hope in Copywriting
If relevance is how you connect with your reader, and curiosity is how you turn that connection into interest, hope is how you transform your reader’s interest into a burning desire. Think of hope as the fuel that amplifies interest until your reader can almost feel the desired benefits in their nervous system.
I refer to this as creating a "synthetic experience." A synthetic experience happens when your reader imagines the benefits of your product or service so vividly that it changes their brain chemistry (more on this later). This feeling is what propels your reader from simply being interested to eagerly anticipating the outcome of your offer.
 
The Role of Hope in Copywriting
Hope in copywriting is defined as “the anticipation of a relevant and valuable experience.” The key term here is anticipation—your reader should expect to experience the benefits of your product or service and become emotionally involved with that expectation.
Many marketing efforts generate interest but fail to convert it into action because they lack hope. Think about this:
•	How many qualified prospects see your ad but never respond?
•	How many visitors land on your website, only to leave without taking action?
•	How many subscribers on your email list never open your emails?
At some point, these individuals were interested, but they lost the anticipation of experiencing the value your product offers. This is where hope comes in—keeping them emotionally involved with the anticipated benefits.
 
Examples of Hope in Copywriting
In previous articles, we covered relevance and curiosity. Now, let's build on those concepts and explore how to create hope by focusing on two aspects:
•	Semantic Hope: Your reader’s internal dialogue.
•	Emotional Hope: The emotional frame of that dialogue.
Hope is centered around the benefits your product or service offers. What does your reader think and feel when they imagine themselves using your product? Let’s look at an example.
 
Hope in Copywriting: Example #1
Let’s revisit our amateur bodybuilder from previous examples. He wants to gain 20 pounds of muscle, and here’s what he might be saying to himself:
•	“I want a bigger chest and arms.”
•	“I want to be one of the biggest guys at my gym.”
•	“I want people to notice when I take off my shirt.”
These thoughts represent semantic hope—clear expressions of the reader’s goals. But for hope to truly spark desire, we need to add emotional depth. What is this bodybuilder feeling as he imagines his future self? Perhaps pride, excitement, and validation.
Let’s look at how we might write copy to reflect that emotional frame:
 
How I Went from Being a Hard-Gainer to One of the Biggest Guys at My Gym
[RELEVANCE]
I once idolized the big guys at my gym—the ones with Jason Momoan pecs, shoulders like boulders, and veins popping from their arms like garden hoses. I’d stare in envy, thinking:
“That guy has to be on the juice.”
Five years of killing myself in the gym only gained me 10 pounds of muscle.
[HOPE]
But today, I’m one of the biggest guys at the gym. Now, I’m the one people stare at when I take off my shirt.
I get questions from the “skinny guys” asking me:
•	“What supplements are you using?”
•	“What’s your workout routine?”
•	“How can I build arms like yours?”
Think this couldn’t happen to you? You won’t think so for long. [CURIOSITY]
Here’s the first thing you need to know about getting big...
 
This example turns our reader’s desires into hope. The internal dialogue about building muscle becomes tangible with the emotional fuel of pride and validation. We’ve transformed curiosity into eager anticipation, making the reader desire the outcome even more.
 
Hope in Copywriting: Example #2
Next, let’s use a different buyer persona—a mid-thirties mom wanting to lose weight after having her second child. Here’s what she might be thinking:
•	“I just want to feel good again.”
•	“I want to fit into my favorite jeans.”
•	“I want to eat dessert without guilt.”
These are expressions of semantic hope. But to turn this into a compelling message, we need to layer in the emotions—happiness, confidence, and relief.
 
I Just Wanted to Feel Good Again
[HOPE]
Nellie just wanted to feel good again. She didn’t need to fit into size four jeans or run marathons.
“I just want to fit into my size eight jeans and enjoy dessert without feeling guilty,” she said as she pulled a pair of jeans from her closet.
If you’re a mom of two or three who’s tired of fad diets and just wants to feel happy again, you’ll be inspired by Nellie’s story. One year ago, she was a size 14. Today, she’s a size 7—and happier than ever.
[RELEVANCE]
“I was tired of starving myself and feeling guilty about having a piece of cheesecake,” Nellie said. “I tried everything. Nothing worked. [HOPE] Then, I discovered something that changed my life forever.”
 
In this case, the reader’s semantic hope (losing weight, fitting into jeans) is enhanced by emotional hope (feeling happy, free from guilt). We’ve tapped into the deeper emotional needs, like happiness and comfort, rather than focusing on superficial benefits.
 
How to Apply Hope in Copywriting
To master hope in copywriting, you need to:
1.	Define Your Buyer Persona.
2.	Envision Their Ideal Day.
	o	What does life look like after using your product or service?
3.	Understand Their Internal Dialogue.
	o	What do they think when they imagine those benefits?
4.	Identify the Emotional Frame of Their Desires.
	o	What emotions accompany their internal dialogue?
By defining these aspects, you can shape your copy to resonate deeply with both the semantic and emotional hopes of your audience.
 
Mastering Hope in Copywriting
Remember, hope in copywriting isn’t just about showing the benefits of your product—it’s about making your reader feel those benefits as vividly as if they were already experiencing them. To do this, you need to dive into their internal dialogue and their emotional needs.
When done right, hope becomes the fuel that propels your reader from mere interest to active desire, bridging the gap between curiosity and action.
 
Next Step: Turn Hope into Urgency
In the next article, we’ll explore how to turn this desire into urgency, the final push that compels readers to act on their hope.
