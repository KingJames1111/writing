Urgency in Copywriting
There are two ways to create urgency in copywriting: external pressure and internal pressure. External pressure is simpler and involves things like limited-time offers. Internal pressure, on the other hand, is more nuanced but far more powerful. In fact, when done correctly, internal pressure amplifies the effectiveness of any limited-time offer.
 
The Role of Urgency in Copywriting
Urgency in copywriting is rooted in a psychological phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance occurs when someone holds conflicting beliefs or behaves in ways that are inconsistent with their values. This psychological discomfort pushes people to resolve the conflict—either by changing their behavior or rationalizing their current behavior to align with their beliefs.
When applied to copywriting, creating urgency means contrasting your reader’s present situation (their pain or frustration) with the benefits your product or service offers. By making this contrast clear and powerful, you push the reader to make a decision that aligns their actions with their desires or values.
Your goal is to make the reader feel like they have two options:
1.	Take action and solve the problem.
2.	Sit in discomfort, rationalizing inaction.
If you do this well, you create a sense of urgency that drives conversions.
 
Examples of Urgency in Copywriting
To create urgency, you need to contrast the positive emotions associated with solving a problem with the negative emotions that arise from staying stuck in the same situation.
Here are three examples of how urgency can be created, each one catering to a different emotional need.
 
Urgency in Copywriting: Example #1 (Validation)
Scenario: The reader is a freelance graphic designer who struggles to attract high-paying clients and is stuck in low-paying gigs. They want to feel valued and respected for their work.
 
Which Designer Do You Want to Be?
In the world of design, there are creators who are recognized, sought after, and paid handsomely. [CONTRAST >]And then, there are the ones who remain stuck doing small jobs for clients who don’t appreciate their creativity. They never get the recognition or the pay they deserve.[< CONTRAST]
The choice is yours. [CONTRAST WITH HOPE >]You can either continue taking on low-paying gigs, feeling undervalued, or you can break out and become the kind of designer everyone is talking about—the one whose work commands respect and premium prices.[< CONTRAST WITH HOPE]
[REVISITING PRESENT PAIN >]You’ve already spent years waiting for that breakthrough client or that next big opportunity. But deep down, you know that if you don’t make a change now, you’ll still be waiting a year from now.[< REVISITING PRESENT PAIN]
This program was created specifically for designers like you—those ready to step up and claim the recognition they’ve worked so hard for. The only question left is: Will you take that step today, or stay stuck where you are?
 
Urgency in Copywriting: Example #2 (Excitement)
Scenario: The reader is a professional looking for a change. They want to transition into a more exciting and fulfilling career but are nervous about taking the first step.
 
Isn’t It Time to Start Living the Life You’ve Dreamed Of?
You’ve thought about it countless times. [BOREDOM >]You’ve sat in meetings, stared out the window, and wondered what it would be like to wake up excited about your day, your work, your life.[< BOREDOM]
Now, imagine this: [EXCITEMENT >]waking up to a career you love, one where every day feels like an opportunity to do something great, to create, and to make an impact.[< EXCITEMENT]
[CONTRAST WITH HOPE >]The freedom, the energy, the passion—those are all within reach, but only if you take action now. You can either continue wishing for change or you can join this program and start creating it.[< CONTRAST WITH HOPE]
[REVISITING PRESENT PAIN >]The longer you wait, the further away that dream feels. The clock is ticking, and every day you don’t take action is a day lost.[< REVISITING PRESENT PAIN]
Isn’t it time to make the leap?
 
Urgency in Copywriting: Example #3 (Security)
Scenario: The reader is a small business owner who has been struggling to maintain steady revenue. They want security and confidence in their financial future.
 
Take Control of Your Business’s Future
Right now, your business is struggling to stay consistent. [FEAR >]You know the pain of seeing revenue drop, worrying if the next client will come through. It’s exhausting, and it’s keeping you up at night.[< FEAR]
Imagine this instead: [SECURITY >]your business running like a well-oiled machine. You have a steady stream of clients, predictable revenue, and a clear plan for growth.[< SECURITY]
[CONTRAST WITH HOPE >]You can either keep wondering how you’ll make it through the next quarter, or you can take control of your business’s future by joining this program. This is the path to the stability you crave.[< CONTRAST WITH HOPE]
[REVISITING PRESENT PAIN >]You’ve already spent months (maybe years) on the rollercoaster of unpredictable revenue. Don’t let another year go by without making the changes you need to secure your business’s future.[< REVISITING PRESENT PAIN]
The choice is yours: continue living with the fear of uncertainty, or take control today.
 
How to Apply Urgency in Copywriting
To apply urgency in your copy, follow this process:
1.	Understand Your Buyer Persona: Identify their emotional needs and pain points.
2.	Create Contrast: Show them the stark difference between their current reality and the reality your product or service offers.
3.	Revisit Present Pain: Remind them of the pain they’re currently experiencing and how staying where they are will only prolong it.
4.	Use Hope and Fear: Appeal to their desire for a better future (hope) and their fear of staying stuck (pain).
 
Mastering Urgency in Copywriting
The key to mastering urgency in copywriting is to stop focusing on selling products and services and start focusing on selling experiences. You want your reader to feel the change that your product or service can create in their life.
The emotions you stir in your copy should last long after they’ve seen your message. This ensures that your product stays in their mind and becomes something they can’t stop thinking about—until they take action.
When you master urgency in copywriting, you create an internal pressure so powerful that the only way for your reader to relie#ve it is to make a decision and buy.
