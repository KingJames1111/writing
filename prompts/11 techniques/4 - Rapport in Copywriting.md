Rapport in Copywriting (Generic Version)
The Role of Rapport in Copywriting
If relevance is how you connect with your reader, and curiosity is how you turn that connection into interest, and hope is how you turn that interest into desire, rapport is how you turn that desire into motivation.
Rapport is about creating a bond between you and your reader, dissolving their fears and objections, and positioning yourself as someone they can trust. Without trust, even the most compelling offer will fall flat. Trust comes from rapport, which I define as a relationship built on “mutual trust or emotional affinity.”
Affinity is the key here. When your reader feels like they share something in common with you, they’re more likely to trust your message. This could be shared values, experiences, or even speech patterns. This phenomenon is grounded in psychology, specifically the “mere liking effect,” which shows that people tend to trust those who resemble them in some way.
The Secret of Rapport
People trust people who are like them. Rapport, in this context, is built when your reader feels a natural affinity with you or the person in your story. Once you establish rapport, your reader will be more inclined to believe your claims, accept your advice, and take action on your offer.
Your goal is to create a sense of “this person is like me,” or “this person understands me.” It’s important to note that rapport is more about how your reader feels than what they logically think. They don’t need a rational explanation to trust you; they simply need to feel a connection.
Examples of Rapport in Copywriting
Let’s build on some earlier examples of copywriting and see how rapport can be integrated.
Example #1: The Hard-gainer Bodybuilder
[RELEVANCE >] “I once idolized the big guys at my gym. They had muscles like football helmets and biceps with veins like garden hoses. Every day, I watched them effortlessly lifting weights that I couldn’t dream of picking up.” [< RELEVANCE]
[HOPE >] “Today, I’m one of the biggest guys at the gym. I don’t just look strong; I feel confident when I walk into the room. I know people are watching and wondering what my secret is.” [< HOPE]
[CURIOSITY >] “What if I told you that I didn’t win the genetic lottery? I used to be just like you, struggling to put on muscle and embarrassed to take my shirt off in front of others.” [< CURIOSITY]
[RAPPORT >] “Like you, I was frustrated. I missed out on a lot of things because I didn’t have the body I wanted. Beach trips with my friends? Forget about it. I didn’t want anyone to see me with my shirt off. I spent years lifting weights and eating like a horse, just to gain a few pounds of muscle. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong or that I was just destined to be ‘the skinny guy’ forever. Sound familiar?” [< RAPPORT]
This example builds rapport by showing the reader that the writer has been where they are. The reader recognizes their own struggles in the writer’s story and feels a connection. This emotional affinity makes it easier for the reader to trust what comes next.
Example #2: The Post-Pregnancy Weight Loss Journey
[HOPE >] “Nellie just wanted to fit into her size 8 jeans again. She didn’t need to run a marathon or fit into a size 2. She just wanted to feel good about herself when she looked in the mirror.” [< HOPE]
[RELEVANCE >] “Like many moms, she was tired of fad diets and feeling guilty every time she ate a slice of cake. No matter what she tried, the weight just wouldn’t come off.” [< RELEVANCE]
[RAPPORT >] “Your second pregnancy was different, wasn’t it? You were more tired, you gained weight faster, and it’s been harder to lose. You’re not alone. Most women don’t know why their second pregnancy is so different, and Nellie didn’t either. Like you, she tried every diet and workout routine she could find, but nothing worked. That’s when she learned a secret that changed everything…” [< RAPPORT]
This example builds rapport by acknowledging the specific struggles of a mom after a second pregnancy. It uses shared experiences to create a bond between the reader and Nellie, the story’s protagonist. The reader feels understood, and that makes them more likely to trust the solution being offered.
How to Apply Rapport in Copywriting
The key to mastering rapport in copywriting is knowing your reader deeply—what are their struggles, their desires, and their experiences? You must tap into these elements to create a connection. Here are the primary data points to focus on when building rapport:
1.	Demographic Data: Who are they? (Age, gender, income level, occupation)
2.	Psychographic Data: What are their values, fears, and desires?
3.	Dog Whistle Language: What are the specific terms, slang, or cultural references that resonate with them?
4.	Stage of Awareness: Where are they in their journey? Are they aware of the solution, or are they just learning about it?
Use these data points to craft a message that sounds like it’s coming from someone who understands your reader intimately. Make them feel like they’re not just another face in the crowd but that you’re speaking directly to them.
