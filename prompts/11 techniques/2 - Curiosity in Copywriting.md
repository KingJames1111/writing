Curiosity in Copywriting
If relevance is how you connect with your reader, curiosity is how you turn that connection into interest. Think of curiosity as the psychological glue that keeps your reader's attention on the page or keeps them tuned into your message, whether it's written, video, or audio.
That's why curiosity is the second of the 10 Persuasive Copywriting Techniques. It's the bridge between the first technique (relevance) and the others. Curiosity in copywriting can be defined as "the expectation of a relevant and valuable discovery."
 
The Role of Curiosity in Copywriting
When your reader expects to discover something relevant and valuable in your message, they're far more likely to stay engaged. Some marketers call this "holding their attention," but curiosity does more than that—it creates a desire to satisfy a mental itch.
In today's world, where distractions are everywhere, even an interested reader can be pulled away. Curiosity is how you ensure they will want to come back to your message to satisfy their need to know more. Using curiosity effectively is tricky, but it's a skill worth mastering.
 
Two Types of Curiosity in Copywriting
1.	High-Value Curiosity
2.	Low-Value Curiosity
Low-value curiosity appeals to the base desire for novelty or intrigue but doesn’t offer any real promise of value. This is common in clickbait and tabloid headlines. It may capture a click, but it won’t hold interest for long.
Example: "Weird Trick for Losing Belly Fat"
In contrast, high-value curiosity leverages both relevance and the expectation of a valuable discovery. It builds trust by promising the reader that the payoff will be worth it.
Example: "How I Closed a $100,000 SEO Client with This One Tactic"
 
Examples of Curiosity in Copywriting
The previous technique introduced relevance. Now, we will build on that by layering in high-value curiosity to hold the reader's attention.
 
Curiosity in Copywriting: Example #1
“What’s With this pinching pain in my right elbow?”
David loved golf but started feeling a sharp pain in his elbow. A year later, he had a choice: spend $10,000 on surgery or give up golf forever.
Curious yet? By using relevance (golf, elbow pain) and introducing a decision, we encourage the reader to wonder, "What happened to David?"
 
Curiosity in Copywriting: Example #2
“How I Caught my Husband in His Second Affair”
After forgiving her husband once, she starts noticing suspicious late-night texts. Dr. Ken Hitchens, a 30-year marriage counselor, says, "A man's second affair is different. He usually does two things differently. Once you know what they are, you'll know whether he's cheating."
This example pulls the reader in with a relevant problem and then introduces curiosity with the promise of a valuable insight.
 
How to Apply Curiosity in Copywriting
To use curiosity effectively:
1.	Start with Relevance: Your curiosity must relate to the reader’s existing concerns.
2.	Ask the Right Question: What is the most eye-opening thing you can reveal about their problem?
3.	Create Anticipation: Give them enough to be curious but hold back the full reveal to keep them reading.
4.	Deliver High Value: Ensure the payoff is significant and useful.
 
Mastering Curiosity in Copywriting
When mastered, curiosity becomes a powerful tool to engage readers and guide them through your message. To succeed, focus on high-value curiosity—one that both grabs attention and holds it by promising a meaningful discovery.
