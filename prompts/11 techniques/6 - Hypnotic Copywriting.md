Technique #6: Hypnotic Copywriting
Hypnotic Copywriting: a style of writing that engages the emotions of the reader by using words, phrases, and descriptions that appeal to one or more of the five senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell).
 
In the first four articles, we discussed how to turn attention into interest, interest into desire, and desire into urgency. As mentioned before, the final techniques focus on turning urgency into action. Hypnotic copywriting is the sixth technique, focusing on creating a mental "trance" that immerses your reader into a synthetic experience—a powerful method of engaging emotions and making your product or service irresistible.
The Role of Hypnotic Copywriting
Hypnotic copywriting is about creating what I call a synthetic experience—a vivid and engaging scenario in the reader’s imagination that feels so real it alters their physical and emotional state. In other words, your writing can create physiological responses in the reader’s nervous system simply by describing a scene or an experience using sensory words.
Let’s try a quick exercise. Close your eyes and imagine your favorite dish being served to you at your favorite restaurant. The aroma fills your nose as you breathe in deeply. You pick up your fork, and the moment it touches your mouth, the flavors burst—rich, satisfying, with the perfect temperature and texture. You can almost taste it, can’t you?
This is the power of hypnotic copywriting. The scenario I described wasn’t real, but your body and mind responded to it as though it was. Your heart rate may have quickened, and your mouth may have started watering. This is how sensory details engage your reader’s senses, making the experience vivid, personal, and emotionally engaging.
The Goal: Use sensory words and descriptions that appeal to sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell to create a mental movie that makes your product feel real and irresistible.
Examples of Hypnotic Copywriting
Let's dive into a few examples, one for each of the five senses, and break down how they engage readers through sensory language.
 
Example #1: Sight Words
Imagine our reader is considering a vacation. We need to appeal to their visual senses to paint a picture they can’t resist:
 
"Picture This…"
You step onto your private balcony, and endless miles of blue-green ocean stretch out before you. Beams of sunlight reflect off the clear, turquoise water, and you can see schools of colorful fish swimming just beneath the surface. The golden sand glistens, and palm trees sway in the breeze as waves lap gently at the shore. This is your tropical paradise.
 
Notice how we engage the reader’s sight with descriptions like "blue-green ocean," "turquoise water," and "golden sand." By inviting the reader to "Picture this…", we help them visualize the scene, which brings the vacation closer to reality in their minds.
 
Example #2: Sound Words
Imagine that the product is a high-end luxury car, and we want to emphasize the auditory experience of driving it:
 
"Listen Closely…"
As you press the pedal, you hear the soft growl of the V8 engine roaring to life. The tires hum smoothly against the pavement as the wind whistles softly past the windows. The sound system fills the cabin with the crystal-clear tones of your favorite song, and everything else fades into the background. It’s just you, the road, and the music.
 
In this example, we focus on the sounds: the "soft growl" of the engine, the "hum" of the tires, and the music filling the car. These sensory details create an immersive auditory experience that makes the reader imagine themselves in the driver’s seat.
 
Example #3: Touch Words
Now, let’s imagine a product like a leather jacket, where we want to emphasize how it feels:
 
"Feel This…"
Slide your arms into the buttery soft leather sleeves, and instantly, the cool material starts to warm against your skin. The snug fit feels like it was made just for you. As you zip it up, the smooth, thick leather molds perfectly to your body, offering warmth, comfort, and confidence with every movement.
 
This example focuses on touch: the "buttery soft leather," the jacket warming against the skin, and the feel of it molding to the body. These tactile descriptions invite the reader to imagine what wearing the jacket feels like, enhancing the appeal.
 
Example #4: Taste Words
Now, let’s create a scenario for a gourmet meal delivery service:
 
"Now Take a Bite…"
Sink your teeth into a juicy, perfectly seasoned filet mignon, cooked just the way you like it. The flavors explode in your mouth—the richness of the beef, the earthy tang of rosemary, and the subtle heat of black pepper. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables, every bite is a symphony of flavor.
 
Here, we use taste words: "juicy," "richness of the beef," "earthy tang of rosemary." These descriptions make the reader imagine the food, sparking a craving that only ordering the meal can satisfy.
 
Example #5: Smell Words
Imagine we’re selling scented candles, and we want to convey their sensory appeal:
 
"Breathe it In…"
As soon as you light the candle, the scent of fresh lavender and vanilla fills the air. It’s calming, warm, and soothing, like a gentle embrace at the end of a long day. The soft, floral notes of the lavender mix with the rich sweetness of vanilla, creating a fragrant haven of relaxation.
 
This example emphasizes smell: "fresh lavender," "rich sweetness of vanilla." These words bring the fragrance to life in the reader’s mind, creating a craving for the peaceful, aromatic environment the candle provides.
 
How to Apply Hypnotic Copywriting
1.	Engage the Senses: Always aim to evoke at least one of the five senses—sight, sound, touch, taste, or smell. The more senses you engage, the more immersive the experience will be.
2.	Use Vivid, Specific Language: Abstract phrases like "comfortable" or "beautiful" don’t engage the imagination. Use vivid language that makes your reader feel, hear, or taste what you’re describing.
3.	Create a Mental Movie: Your goal is to make the reader feel like they are experiencing your product in real-time. This makes your offer more appealing, creating a deep emotional connection.
4.	Contrast with Reality: Use dissonance by contrasting the imagined experience with the reader’s current reality. This makes the imagined scenario even more desirable, prompting them to take action.
 
Mastering Hypnotic Copywriting
The key to mastering hypnotic copywriting is to practice using sensory words in your writing. Start by building a list of words that appeal to sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Then, begin using them to create vivid experiences that immerse your reader in the benefits of your product or service.
The second step is using these words to move the reader down the Ladder of Abstraction, from conceptual ideas to sensory engagement. Mastering this process will elevate your writing, making it more engaging, memorable, and persuasive.
