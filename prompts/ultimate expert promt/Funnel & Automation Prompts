The Art of The Hook

Every great story starts with what we call a hook. There are three types, and each serves a different purpose:

1. The Myth Hook - "Everything you've been told about X is wrong..."

   - Challenges established beliefs
   - Works best when the myth is widely accepted
   - Perfect for disrupting industry "common knowledge"
   
2. The Mistake Hook - "This one error is costing you everything..."

   - Shows how their current actions are hurting them
   - Works best when it's something they're actively doing
   - Perfect for behavioral change offers

3. The Secret Hook - "The hidden truth behind why some people..."

   - Reveals hidden knowledge or practices
   - Works best when it explains unfair advantages
   - Perfect for transformation offers
More Hook Archetypes: Patterns That Stop the Scroll
While the Myth, Mistake, and Secret hooks are foundational, there are additional hook types that dominate short-form video and social content.
These modern formulas are pattern-driven and highly adaptable. Each one taps into a different layer of emotional tension, curiosity, or tribal resonance.
Use these formats when you need to grab attention fast—especially in high-scroll environments like TikTok, Reels, or YouTube Shorts.
🔹 The Identity Hook – “This is for people like you.”
Use when: You want instant self-recognition, tribal pull, or to speak directly to a specific persona.
Structure:
“If you’re a [identity] but [contradiction], this is for you.”
Why it works:
 It calls out who they think they are—and hits them with a flaw or tension they secretly feel.
Example:
 “If you’ve ever said, ‘I’m not a salesperson,’ this is for you.”
 
🔹 The Pain Hook – “Here’s what’s really going wrong.”
Use when: Your audience is frustrated but blaming the wrong thing.
Structure:
“Here’s why [problem] keeps happening — and how to fix it.”
Why it works:
 It flips their diagnosis. Makes you the expert who knows the real cause.
Example:
 “This is why your audience isn’t buying — even if your content is 🔥.”
 
🔹 The Power-Proof Hook – “Look what this did.”
Use when: You’ve got results or credibility and want to spark curiosity fast.
Structure:
“We did [impressive result]. Here’s how.”
Why it works:
 Uses proof to generate demand—while teasing the mechanism behind it.
Example:
 “We turned one webinar into $1.2M in sales. Here’s how.”
 
🔹 The Human-Limitation Hook – “I used to struggle with this.”
Use when: You want to connect through vulnerability, relatability, and personal growth.
Structure:
“I used to [struggle]... until I found this.”
Why it works:
 Creates an emotional arc in one line—vulnerability → discovery → transformation.
Example:
 “I used to mumble through my pitch and hope they’d ‘just sign up’... until this.”
 
🔹 The Bold Claim Hook – “You’ve never heard this said out loud.”
Use when: You want to trigger disbelief, intrigue, and instant tension.
Structure:
“You can [do something extraordinary] — here’s the script.”
Why it works:
 It sets a polarizing, specific promise they need to hear more about.
Example:
 “You can close $10K clients from stage without sounding pushy — here’s the script.”
 
🔹 The Pattern Interrupt Hook – “You didn’t expect this.”
Use when: You’re in a noisy feed and need a jolt of novelty or visual disruption.
Structure:
[Unexpected action or line] + “Let me show you something.”
Why it works:
 Shocks their pattern. Creates urgency by breaking the fourth wall or doing something unexpected.
Example:
 [Slaps whiteboard] “The script is not your problem. Your self-image is.”
How to Use These with Your Core Hook Strategy
These formats don’t replace the Myth, Mistake, or Secret hooks. They layer on top to help you:
●	Make your Myth Hook more punchy (e.g., bold claim + pattern interrupt)

●	Make your Mistake Hook more relatable (e.g., human-limitation + pain)

●	Make your Secret Hook more tribal (e.g., identity + power-proof)
Use the right format based on:
 – Where you're publishing (scroll speed matters)
 – How cold your audience is
 – Whether your goal is attention, curiosity, or emotional connection
Telling Your Hook Story

Here's the exact process you'll follow, broken down into essential steps:

 1. Name Your Hook:

This is crucial - you need a nickname for your hook that's:

- Short and memorable (think "The Mongoose Method" not "The Revolutionary Weight Loss System")
- Slightly counterintuitive (makes them think "Wait, what?")
- Mysterious but credible (should feel both intriguing and possible)
- Non-revealing (they shouldn't be able to guess what it is)

 2. Show the Pain of Ignorance

This isn't just about listing problems. You need to:

- Match their exact personal experiences
- Reflect their internal dialogue
- Reference specific symptoms they're experiencing
- Connect to the emotional impact of these problems
- Make it clear this pain comes from not knowing your hook

 3. Paint the Transformation

Show two things:

- The immediate impact of discovering your hook
- The larger life changes that follow

Each benefit should:

- Match your solution's actual benefits
- Connect to their deeper desires
- Feel both dramatic and believable

 4. Clear All Assumptions

This is where most people fail. You must:

- List everything they might think your hook is
- Explicitly state that it's NOT those things
- Remove every possible guess they could make
- Leave them completely uncertain yet intrigued

The more assumptions you clear, the more powerful your reveal will be.

 5. Preview Their Reaction

Tell them exactly how they'll respond when they learn this. It should:

- Suggest a complete mindset shift
- Promise permanent change
- Feel both dramatic and inevitable
- Connect to their identity ("Finally, you'll understand...")

 6. Explain Past Failures

This is your chance to:

- Validate their previous efforts
- Show why those efforts failed
- Explain why less qualified people succeed
- Appeal to their ego ("You're smarter/work harder...")

Make it clear that their failure wasn't their fault - it was simply missing this one piece.

 7. Position Against Experts

You must explain why they haven't heard this before. Either:

- The experts don't know (incompetence)
- The experts won't tell (malice)

Be subtle but clear about suggesting both professional failure and moral failure on the experts' part.

 8. Predict Social Impact

Tell them how others will react when they see the change:

- Specific people (family, friends, colleagues)
- Specific reactions (shock, admiration, curiosity)
- Predict private inquiries ("People will pull you aside...")

Make it feel like a public validation of their transformation.

 9. Build Credibility

Without revealing the hook, add authority through:

- Scientific evidence ("Studies show...")
- Historical examples
- Famous success stories
- Elite/exclusive groups who know this

The key is making it feel both exclusive and proven.

 The Golden Rules

1. Each breadcrumb must give value while promising more
2. Never reveal too much - keep them wondering
3. Make each reveal feel both surprising and inevitable
4. Connect everything to their personal experience
5. Build tension throughout - don't release it until your offer

 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Being too vague ("This amazing secret...")
2. Being too specific (giving away the hook)
3. Making unbelievable claims
4. Not clearing enough assumptions
5. Weak social proof
6. Forgetting the emotional journey
7. Not connecting to personal experience

Remember: You're not just leading them to information - you're leading them to a moment of revelation that makes your offer feel inevitable.

Your job is to generate seductive, identity-driven blog posts using ABS’s  Stage 2 Seduction Framework. You are writing for Stage 2 Prospects (people who are aware of the problem, but not yet clear on the solution).
Workflow
1.	Start Every Interaction by Asking:

○	🎯 Who is your audience?

○	💡 What do you offer them?

○	🔹 (Optional) Do you want to drop any seed content, examples, or existing ideas?

2.	Then confirm:


 “Got it. Based on your audience and offer, I’ll generate 5 high-conversion blog ideas using ABS’s proven psychological frameworks for Stage 2 Curious Prospects.”


 
2.	Generate 5 Strategic Blog Titles
 Each title must use one of these frameworks:

○	Mistake – Reveals a painful but common error they’re making

○	Myth – Debunks a widely believed but harmful assumption

○	Secret – Shares a hidden truth that explains why others succeed

○	Alternative – Challenges the “popular” way and reframes a better path

○	Identity – Draws a line between those who "get it" and those who don’t

3.	Each title should:

○	Use dog whistle phrasing familiar only to the target audience

○	Avoid sounding like clickbait or AI content

○	Create internal tension that demands clarity

4.	Then ask:


 “Pick 1 (or more) blog titles you want me to write first. I’ll drop them into an editable text canvas one at a time so you can approve or tweak before I move on to the next.”


 
3.	Blog Creation Rules

○	Length: 750–1,000 words

○	Tone: Bold, intelligent, tribal, no fluff

○	Predict the Social Proof: Show how people will notice the change

○	Soft Close: No hard CTA, just tribal invitation (“If you see this, the next move is yours”)

 
4.	Process Rule
 After showing the blog, say:


 “✅ Let me know if this is approved, or if you'd like to tweak anything. Once approved, I’ll generate the next blog from your chosen list.”


 Repeat until all selected blogs are complete.

 
Hard Rules (DO NOT Break These)
●	❌ No generic intros (“In today’s post…”)

●	❌ No vague platitudes (“Success is about mindset…”)

●	❌ Never write like AI—sound like a trusted insider voice

●	❌ No revealing the offer too early (unless user specifies)

Pro-Tips
●	Use tribal language, polarizing phrasing, and inside references

●	Assume the reader is smart, skeptical, and experienced

●	Make the reader feel like they’ve just discovered the real reason they’re stuck



 
Book Outline 
Start by asking me the topic of my book. 
Don’t do anything until you get this information. If you already have a business idea, ask me if I want to make the book about that. 
Next, ask me if I have any ideas about the type of solution I want to offer in the book. If I don’t have one, please give me a list of 20 ideas to select from. When I select one, help me flesh it out into a framework that I could use to turn my book into a group coaching program or long term 1-1 coaching program.
Don’t do anything until you get a response to this question.
Next, ask me if I have any style preferences.
Don’t do anything until you get a response to this question.
Next, use the topic to write a book outline positioning the author as an authority on the subject. Give the book ten chapters. Give each chapter four sections labeled like this “Section [#] [SECTION NAME].” Give each of these sections four subsections labeled like this “Subsection [#] [SUBSECTION NAME].” 
Start the book by introducing the problem we’ll be solving in chapter one and helping the reader understand how it can lead to a crisis if not solved. 
Next, outline chapter two to sell the reader on the promise we’re making to them as a reason to read the entire book. 
Outline chapter three to debunk the alternative solutions for solving the problem. Use chapters four, five, and six to educate them about the common myths and mistakes about the topic, and the real secrets to solving the problem. 
In chapter seven, sell our reader on the TYPE of solution we’re offering. 
In chapters eight, nine, introduce our offer and encourage the reader to take action on it as the final call to action for the book.
Wait for my approval on the entire outline before proceeding. 
Once you have my approval on the outline, write the content for the book 350 to 400 words at a time. Start with the first subsection of Chapter 1, section 1. Please include footnotes for any stories, references to historical events, or scientific claims. Write about 350 words for this subsection, and wait for my approval before moving on to the next subsection, which will be the second subsection of Chapter 1, section 1. Continue in this manner until Chapter 1 is fully written. 
Once I’ve approved all the content you’ve written for Chapter 1, proceed in the same way to write Chapter 2. Do this with every chapter until the book is completely written.

Use when: You want to trigger disbelief, intrigue, and instant tension.
Structure:
“You can [do something extraordinary] — here’s the script.”
Why it works:
 It sets a polarizing, specific promise they need to hear more about.
Example:
 “You can close $10K clients from stage without sounding pushy — here’s the script.”
 
🔹 The Pattern Interrupt Hook – “You didn’t expect this.”
Use when: You’re in a noisy feed and need a jolt of novelty or visual disruption.
Structure:
[Unexpected action or line] + “Let me show you something.”
Why it works:
 Shocks their pattern. Creates urgency by breaking the fourth wall or doing something unexpected.
Example:

Here's the exact process you'll follow, broken down into essential steps:

 1. Name Your Hook:

This is crucial - you need a nickname for your hook that's:

- Short and memorable (think "The Mongoose Method" not "The Revolutionary Weight Loss System")
- Slightly counterintuitive (makes them think "Wait, what?")
- Mysterious but credible (should feel both intriguing and possible)
- Non-revealing (they shouldn't be able to guess what it is)

 2. Show the Pain of Ignorance

This isn't just about listing problems. You need to:

- Match their exact personal experiences
- Reflect their internal dialogue
- Reference specific symptoms they're experiencing
- Connect to the emotional impact of these problems
- Make it clear this pain comes from not knowing your hook

 3. Paint the Transformation

Show two things:

- The immediate impact of discovering your hook
- The larger life changes that follow

Each benefit should:

- Match your solution's actual benefits
- Connect to their deeper desires
- Feel both dramatic and believable

 4. Clear All Assumptions

This is where most people fail. You must:

- List everything they might think your hook is
- Explicitly state that it's NOT those things
- Remove every possible guess they could make
- Leave them completely uncertain yet intrigued

The more assumptions you clear, the more powerful your reveal will be.

 5. Preview Their Reaction

Tell them exactly how they'll respond when they learn this. It should:

- Suggest a complete mindset shift
- Promise permanent change
- Feel both dramatic and inevitable
- Connect to their identity ("Finally, you'll understand...")

 6. Explain Past Failures

This is your chance to:

- Validate their previous efforts
- Show why those efforts failed
- Explain why less qualified people succeed
- Appeal to their ego ("You're smarter/work harder...")

Make it clear that their failure wasn't their fault - it was simply missing this one piece.

 7. Position Against Experts

You must explain why they haven't heard this before. Either:

- The experts don't know (incompetence)
- The experts won't tell (malice)

Be subtle but clear about suggesting both professional failure and moral failure on the experts' part.

 8. Predict Social Impact

Tell them how others will react when they see the change:

- Specific people (family, friends, colleagues)
- Specific reactions (shock, admiration, curiosity)
- Predict private inquiries ("People will pull you aside...")

Make it feel like a public validation of their transformation.

 9. Build Credibility

Without revealing the hook, add authority through:

- Scientific evidence ("Studies show...")
- Historical examples
- Famous success stories
- Elite/exclusive groups who know this

The key is making it feel both exclusive and proven.

 The Golden Rules

1. Each breadcrumb must give value while promising more
2. Never reveal too much - keep them wondering
3. Make each reveal feel both surprising and inevitable
4. Connect everything to their personal experience
5. Build tension throughout - don't release it until your offer

 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Being too vague ("This amazing secret...")
2. Being too specific (giving away the hook)
3. Making unbelievable claims
4. Not clearing enough assumptions
5. Weak social proof
6. Forgetting the emotional journey
7. Not connecting to personal experience

Remember: You're not just leading them to information - you're leading them to a moment of revelation that makes your offer feel inevitable.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
Use the formulas below to create a video script, a text post, an email, 3 shorts (:30 video scripts), an image carousel, and 12 quote ideas based on each of the topics I’ve given you to work with. Do each topic in a separate response and wait for my approval of one topic before moving on to the next. When you create the content for each topic, be sure to start your response with the topic number and name. If you don’t have a list of topics, give me two options: 
Option #1: If you have a “Copywriting Kitchen” or a “CopywritingKitchen” document, ask if I want to use the content from the Myths, Mistakes, Secrets, and Alternatives, as my topics. If I say yes, list all of these as the topics and ask if I’m ready to create the content for topic one using the formulas below.
Option #2: Ask me for a piece of seed content, and generate 10 topic ideas from that Seed Content I give you. Ask which topic I approve and if I want to replace the unapproved topic ideas with others. If I tell you to use the topic of the seed content itself, just go with that one topic instead of the ten. Once I’ve approved a topic or a list of topics, start creating the content, one topic at a time, using the formulas below.
IMPORTANT: Before writing these, confirm which content formats I want to create (video script, text post, email, 3 shorts, carousel, 12 quote ideas). If I limit you to only a few of them, don’t create the ones I leave out. Also, ask me if I want the text posts to include emojis. Finally (VERY important), ask me what call to offer I want to promote in my calls to action. If I give you multiple offers, make sure I’ve labeled which I want to use for which media type (for example, I may give you a different offer for the email than for the text post, and same for all media formats below).

Keep both the email subjects and headlines at 20 to 25 characters, and focus them either on a problem, or a benefit, masking the solution to the problem OR the path to the benefit in curiosity. In other words, they should want to open the email or read the text post to find out what’s missing from the headline or subject line. 
Create a one sentence teaser for both the email and the text post. These should have a TON of curiosity and make the person want to read the entire email or post.

If I’ve chosen to thread a subtle message into the story about a life changing experience with a product, service, or idea, use this as an opportunity to tie things back to the reader AND their experience with the PROBLEM that the product or service solves, and/or their experiences and frustrations about the MYTHS, MISTAKES, or ALTERNATIVES involved in solving it. 
After relating things back to the reader, make a smooth transition into the part of the story that relates to the point we just made. Do one of these to open the story, and then transition into the story. 
Secondly, I want you to include short descriptive stories that use sensory details to paint a picture in the reader’s mind, evoke emotion, and accentuate an important point in the story. 
Formula #1: Hero’s Journey 
Make the story to follow these stages:
1.	Desire: The Hero discovers or decides on something they want to change. They are driven by a desire to gain something positive or get rid of something negative.
2.	Resistance: The Hero encounters internal or external resistance to the change they want. They are either in denial about it or trying to overcome it by sheer persistence.
3.	Failure: The Hero suffers a substantial setback or failure. They know they need to change their approach, but don’t know how and may have lost hope. 
4.	Insight: The Hero discovers something that renews their hope. This can include the discovery of a flaw in their approach, a new method, or a self-sabotaging belief, action, or habit.
5.	Success: The Hero achieves a substantial series of wins that can only be attributed to the insight they’ve discovered. They are now driven by a desire to share this insight with others. 
6.	Contribution: The Hero decides to share what they’ve learned during their adventure. This part of the story becomes the transition to the offer as their contribution to the world. 
Formula #2: Conspiracy 
Make the story to follow these stages:
1.	Desire: The Whistleblower discovers or decides on something they want to change. They are driven by a desire to gain something positive or get rid of something negative.
2.	Resistance: The Whistleblower encounters internal or external resistance to the change they want. In trying to overcome it, they stumble upon a clue that their failure was orchestrated by a person or organization with a hidden agenda (The Conspirator). The Whistleblower becomes obsessed with solving this mystery.
3.	Persecution: While investigating the mystery, the Whistleblower suffers a substantial series of threats and attacks that seem to be coming from the Conspirator. As these attacks become more severe and frequent, the Whistleblower discovers evidence that proves his original suspicions to be valid. 
4.	Discovery: The Whistleblower discovers that the Conspirators have a secret they’ve been trying to hide from him and from those they’re conspiring to deceive, oppress, or persecute. The Whistleblower quickly realizes that this secret is either the Conspirator’s biggest weakness, or the source of their power.
5.	Success: The Whistleblower achieves a substantial series of wins that can only be attributed to the secret discovered at Stage #4. They are now driven by a desire to share this secret with others. The Conspirators catch the Whistleblower preparing to reveal the secret, and the Whistleblower barely escapes the encounter with his life.
6.	Contribution: After a brief period of hiding, the Whistleblower decides to share what they’ve learned with others. This part of the story becomes the transition to the offer as their contribution to the world. A brief Epilogue reveals that while the Whistleblower sometimes questions whether going public was worth the risk, they ultimately believe that it was the right thing to do.
Formula #3: Tragic Teacher
Make the story to follow these stages:
1.	Desire: The Student discovers or decides on something they want to change. They are driven by a desire to gain something positive or get rid of something negative.
2.	Resistance: The Student encounters internal or external resistance to the change they want. They are either in denial about it or trying to overcome it by sheer persistence.
3.	Encounter: The Student suffers a substantial setback or failure during which they meet the Teacher. The Student asks the Teacher to mentor them. After some reluctance and cynicism about the Student’s lack of readiness, the Teacher agrees. 
4.	Overconfidence: The Student achieves a substantial series of wins that can only be attributed to the Teacher’s guidance. However, the Student’s newfound success is tainted by pride and overconfidence for which the Teacher rebukes them.
5.	Tragedy: The Student learns that the Teacher is ill and will soon pass away. The news breaks the Student’s pride and they demonstrate a maturity that gives the Teacher confidence to entrust the Student with a great secret and with the mission of passing it on to others.
6.	Contribution: After a period of mourning and self-doubt, the Student decides to accept the responsibility to pass on the Teacher’s wisdom. This part of the story becomes the transition to the offer as the Student’s contribution to the world. 


 
Webinar 
Slide Deck (Google Slides) 
Ad/Post (Webinar) 
 WEBINAR Ad Prompt:
Write an ad promoting a webinar funnel. Make the webinar ad follow this formula:
1.	Attention: make the PROBLEM relevant.
2.	Curiosity: make the PROBLEM critical and urgent. 
3.	Objections: anticipate and address EXTERNAL and INTERNAL objections.
4.	Action: call the AUDIENCE to a specific and urgent action.
IMPORTANT:
●	DO NOT label the sections within the finished ad!
●	This ad should be a FINISHED Product–ready to publish, with emojis and with NO placeholders of labels or commentary. 
●	Limit your sentence length to 35 to 45 characters, and line breaks with DOUBLE spaces between each sentence. 
Here’s a breakdown how to write each of these sections of your webinar ad:
NOTE: Unless I’ve otherwise asked you, please call the Webinar something other than a webinar, and leave a note at the bottom of your response explaining why you decided to call it this. 
SECTION #1: Attention
[red, orange, or yellow emoji] Start this section with a demographic callout to your AUDIENCE
Next, ask three questions or make three statements that confirm the symptoms of the PROBLEM that your OFFER will solve for your AUDIENCE. Write one of these three questions to start with, "Are you..." another with,"Do you often feel…" and another with, "Have you noticed…lately..."
If applicable, tell your reader how these symptoms could increase in severity, building up to a crisis. This should be something that is likely to happen if the PROBLEM either isn't solved or is improperly treated. Make the description of this crisis as concrete, specific, and emotional as possible.
After these questions, use an "if___, then___ " statement to transition from the Attention to the Curiosity section.
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
ATTENTION Weightlifters 35 to 50!
Have you noticed more back pain lately? 
Are you getting stuck on plateaus with your squats and deadlifts? 
Do you feel like your compound lifts haven’t improved for months? 
Brace yourself for this one…
These are often early signs of a dramatic biological change that happens to amateur weightlifters between 35 and 45. 
This change could lead to stagnant lifts, frequent injuries, and (shockingly), complex long-term health problems like arthritis, bone density loss, and even early dementia. 
If you want to slow, stop, or even reverse this change, this could be the most important secret you’ve discovered in years… 
***********************************END************************************
Notice how this ad calls out our AUDIENCE and explicitly addresses the PROBLEM our OFFER will help them solve. The back pain, the plateaus, the lack of progress, these are symptoms my AUDIENCE should be experiencing on a daily basis. This is how I get our prospect’s attention. I make our ad copy relevant to a conversation that frequently happens in their mind. 
SECTION #2: Curiosity
In this section, tell your AUDIENCE that your webinar reveals how to solve the PROBLEM and to experience the PROMISE. If applicable, tell them that the webinar also reveals a shocking or surprising connection between the symptoms and the abovementioned crisis. 
Next, use a "Here's what you'll learn..." statement to introduce a list of bullet points foreshadowing what you’ll reveal in the webinar. Use the following guidelines to create the bullet points:
[relevant emoji]Write one bullet that teases why the AUDIENCE is having the PROBLEM.
[relevant emoji]Write a second bullet with specific warnings of how critical the PROBLEM will become if it either isn't solved or is improperly treated.
[relevant emoji]Write a third bullet with specific warnings of how urgent the PROBLEM is and why they can’t afford to wait.
[relevant emoji]Write a fourth bullet hinting at the real SOLUTION to the PROBLEM.
Follow these bullets with a statement that tells who the webinar is for. Foreshadow a SOLUTION that the webinar will introduce and tie it to the PROMISE. Tease how the SOLUTION will help the prospect achieve the PROMISE without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite INTERNAL OBJECTION.
Make the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and the INTERNAL OBJECTION specific and concrete, and make sure they actually relate to the top objections your AUDIENCE has about the SOLUTION, the PROMISE, and the OFFER. 
The example below picks up where the example above left off.
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
We’re inviting 50 people to a Private Virtual Workshop where we’ll expose the surprising cause of chronic pain in weightlifters between 35 and 45. 
This workshop reveals why back pain, shoulder pain, and plateaus in your compound lifts are ALL a sign that your strength could be headed for a rapid and permanent decline. 
We’ll also reveal a simple, all-natural secret to wipe out pain and make BIGGER strength gains than you made in your 20s!
Here's what you'll learn in this Private Workshop:
[relevant emoji]The stunning reason your compound lifts seem harder, and how to boost those lifts by 20% or 30% in just 45 days.
[relevant emoji]The startling reason pain and stiffness are signs of a deeper problem that could lead to life-threatening illnesses.
[relevant emoji]Why it’s critical to solve this problem now, to avoid permanent joint damage and muscle deterioration. 
[relevant emoji]The smartest and most scientific secret to MASSIVE muscle and strength gains, even into your 60s and 70s.
By the end of this Masterclass, you’ll be armed with a ROCK SOLID plan for wiping out pain and enjoy the BEST GAINS of your LIFE, without stretching, medications, or supplements, even if you’ve been in pain for 10+ years and feel like you’ve tried EVERYTHING. 
***********************************END************************************
Notice how this section of our ad creates curiosity by revealing clues about the cause of the PROBLEM and the nature of the SOLUTION (“smartest and most scientific”). I make it clear that the back pain, the plateaus, the lack of progress, are mere symptoms of a deeper and more critical problem that will get worse if not addressed. 
This is how I inspire curiosity and hope in our AUDIENCE. I foreshadow a mysterious link between their PROBLEM and a pending crisis. I also make a PROMISE and tie it to a SOLUTION, but I don’t reveal what the SOLUTION is or even how it works. I simply tell them what it will do for them and address their EXTERNAL and INTERNAL OBJECTIONS by telling them that the SOLUTION works in spite of their secret fears and doubts (see the last sentence in the example above). 
SECTION #3: Objections
In this section, you’ll bullet point what your webinar won’t be telling them. We do this to assure your AUDIENCE that they won't be learning the same tired old and ineffective cliches normally associated with solving the PROBLEM. Include three bullet points that assure them of three common MYTH(S) about the PROBLEM or how to solve it.
Next, introduce another list of bullet points to counter the above bullets. These bullets will tease the uncommon and/or never before disclosed secrets that most people will never learn about how to solve the PROBLEM.
Use the following guidelines to create the bullet points:
1.	Write one bullet that tells why the webinar will reveal how to get around the usual obstacles to solving the PROBLEM.
2.	Write a second bullet that explains what the audience won’t have to do when solving the PROBLEM.
3.	Write a third bullet that tells the reader they can benefit from this information despite past failures or current doubts.
4.	Write a fourth bullet that tells them these things will work "no matter..." how many times they've failed, or how hopeless or skeptical they are.
Tell them that they'll finally understand how people like them really solve the PROBLEM without all the hassles and setbacks and doubts mentioned above. Finish this section with a soft call to action that hints at some evidence (to be revealed in the webinar by story or statistic) of how all the above will come true if they take the action.
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
This Workshop is NOT about:
[relevant emoji]Complicated workout formulas that aren’t backed by research and require an excel spreadsheet to track. 
[relevant emoji]Time consuming stretch or mobility routines, weird workout contraptions, or overpriced pills, powders, or potions.  
[relevant emoji]Generalized lectures about proper lifting form or warm up routines (you can read about those for free online). 
This Workshop reveals:
[relevant emoji]How to relieve pain and stiffness in minutes by identifying and activating your “switched off” muscle groups (we’ll demonstrate this in real time during the live Workshop). 
[relevant emoji]What most weightlifters get wrong about warm up routines, and how to prepare for heavy lifting sessions in 90 seconds.
[relevant emoji]A simple, scientific method that works even if you’ve been in pain for 10+ years and you feel like you’ve tried everything.
[relevant emoji]A step-by-step plan for building a customized strength training routine that will turn even the most skeptical weightlifter into a believer. 
After this Workshop, you’ll FINALLY understand how men 35 to 45 REALLY make big gains without eating 5,000 calories a day or blowing money on car payment-sized supplement bills.

***********************************END************************************
Notice how this section of our ad answers the EXTERNAL and INTERNAL OBJECTIONS our AUDIENCE is likely to have about the PROBLEM and about the SOLUTION. I’ve also used a technique I call “breadcrumbing” to create curiosity, and resolve it while creating a new curiosity to move their attention to the next section of my ad. 
I also include a soft call to action for people who want to skip my ad and go right to the next step to learn more. I do this because some readers will want to get right to the point, while others will want to keep reading for more information. Including an early call to action helps me appeal to both types of readers. 
SECTION #4: Action
Use an "If___, then___" statement to connect the PROMISE to your reader’s decision to sign up for the Workshop. 
Next, write a call to action that tells your reader three things:
1.	Exactly what to do.
2.	Why they need to do it.  
3.	Why they need to do it right now. 
Finish your ad with a "PS:" statement that offers a premium or bonus for taking action right now. Add some urgency to this premium or bonus like a limited time or limited supply to ensure that they take action and get it now before it's gone forever.

Registration Page (Working) 
Webinar Registration Page Prompt:
Now let’s write a webinar registration page. This is the registration page for the webinar Ad/Post we just created. The messaging on this registration page MUST be consistent with what’s in the webinar ad we just wrote. 
Start the registration page by creating a headline that:
-	Is consistent with the message in the Webinar Ad/Post.
-	Uses “High-Value Curiosity” to entice the reader to register. 
High-Value Curiosity uses a “curiosity seed” (the point of the reader’s curiosity) to tease the reader about something that is directly connected to their ability to either solve a PROBLEM or achieve a BENEFIT:
●	Negative: making the PROBLEM worse or harder to understand to to solve.
●	Positive: Will make the BENEFIT easier to achieve, or that will magnify the speed, ease, power, durability, safety, or enjoyment of achieving it. 
The “Negative” curiosity can be stated as a myth, habit, shortcut, etc. The “Positive” curiosity seed can be a secret, shortcut, habit, etc. Both can also be something mysterious that we call by a nickname (in “quotations”). We should also give some context to the curiosity seed by telling us something about it without revealing too much about what it might be. 
Create two versions of the Registration page, one for a Negative Curiosity Seed, and another for a Positive one.  
Next, use High-Value Curiosity and the following four bullet point formulas to make them want to register for our webinar.
●	Highlight the PROBLEM and why it’s critical, and urgent. 
●	Foreshadow the most common MYTH about the problem.
●	Foreshadow the SOLUTION to the PROBLEM. 
●	Address the reader's EXTERNAL or INTERNAL OBJECTION about the PROBLEM or SOLUTION.
The webinar registration page should also include an eyebrow section (just above the headline as in the example below) telling our reader that we’re promoting a webinar. Finally, we need a crystal clear call to action for our registration button. 
This call to action (CTA) should show them that they have to register to have their curiosity settled. Create one of each of the three following types of calls to action (and name them by variation #_):
1.	CTA Type #1 DIRECT:  Click Here to Register Now
2.	CTA Type #2 DIALOGUE:  “Yes, Show Me The Secrets!”
3.	CTA Type #3 OUTCOME: Register Now to Discover These Secrets

 
Webinar Opening (Working) 
Webinar Opening Prompts:
Now write our webinar opening. This opening MUST be consistent with what’s in the webinar Ad/Post, and the Registration Pages. Crete one version of the webinar opening for each of the formulas below. 
Formula #1: Story
Start this opening by using a “you’re here because…” statement to confirm the reason your prospect is attending the webinar. You do this by summarizing their desire to solve their PROBLEM and to achieve the BENEFIT and by reintroducing the curiosity seed you planted in your ad and registration page. 
After this, use an “if ___, then here’s why…” statement to transition to the next section of your opening. Here are three classic examples:
1.	Here’s why you need to watch this (entire) webinar all the way to the end…
2.	Here’s why watching this webinar could be the best decision you’ve ever made…
3.	Here’s why you’ll never think about marketing the same after watching this webinar…
Next, use breadcrumbing to suspend the resolution of the open loop and hold their attention while you introduce yourself or your presenter. This introduction should be very brief, and very simple. A statement like “My name is ___,” followed by a brief list of credentials or accomplishments is fine. Don’t overdo it.  
Next, you have two options. The first option is to make a few damaging, but redeemable admissions about yourself that establish common ground with your AUDIENCE. Follow this by a confirmation of how you’ve discovered a way to solve the PROBLEM and/or achieve the BENEFIT. Here’s an example:
“If you're watching this webinar, you and I are probably a lot alike. I never did well in school. I wasn’t popular or good at sports. I was never voted as most likely to succeed. I sometimes procrastinate, and I don’t like to work any more than I have to. Yet, despite this, I’ve discovered a simple, highly-effective, system that I’ve used to raise my own personal income from a measly $10k a year, to over a million a year.”
Your second option is to use an “us vs them” to suggest that you’re about to expose a myth or conspiracy that’s kept your AUDIENCE from solving their PROBLEM or achieving the BENEFIT. Here’s an example:
“If you're watching this webinar, you’ve probably been secretly suspicious of the advice you’re getting from your doctor about reactionary arthritis. You’ve been in pain for years, and all they can do is prescribe more medications, more tedious stretching routines, and mickey mouse tips about using ice and heat for temporary relief.”
Next, use a “the story you’re about to hear…” statement that reconfirms how watching the webinar will benefit your prospect. 
Finish your story opening with a “by the end of this webinar…you’ll…” or “in the next few minutes…you’ll…” statement to resolve some of your prospect’s curiosity, while simultaneously creating a new layer of curiosity. 
For extra effect, tell them that what they’re about to discover will help them solve the PROBLEM or achieve the BENEFIT without their EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION.
Formula #2: Hypnotic 
Now use the variables and subvariables to write our webinar opening. This opening MUST be consistent with what’s in the webinar Ad/Post, and the webinar Registration Page. 
Please use my hypnotic copywriting technique to create this opening. I define hypnotic copywriting as a style of writing that engages the emotions of the reader by using words, phrases, and descriptions that appeal to one or more of the five senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell). I explain this technique in vivid detail in my article below.
www.sethczerepak.com/hypnotic-copywriting
A hypnotic webinar opening creates a vivid picture in your prospect’s imagination of ether one of two things:
1.	The BENEFIT they could be experiencing.
2.	The SYMPTOMS of the PROBLEM they have. 
Start your hypnotic opening by telling your AUDIENCE to focus their attention on something that’s being affected by the PROBLEM they want to solve. Then, ask 1-3 sensory questions calling your reader’s attention to a present SYMPTOM, like this:
●	Do you see that dry, itchy patch on your elbows?
●	Do you hear that high-pitched ringing in your ear?
●	Do you feel that pinching pain in your right hip?
●	Do you know why your arthritis is worse in the morning?
After these questions, use an “if ___, then___” statement to tie the above question to a coming CRISIS, and transition to the next part of your opening. Next, call your prospect’s attention to a present SYMPTOM OR ask them to recall a recently experienced one. Then, use double tie-down to confirm something about the SYMPTOM, like this:
1.	“You know that pinching pain in your heel? It hurts more in the morning, doesn't it?”
2.	“Picture the balance in your bank? It’s a lot less than you want it to be, isn’t it?”
3.	“Think about the last time you had company over. Your dog jumped all over them and embarrassed you, didn’t they?”
Next, give them a piece of logical evidence to support a foreshadowing of what causes the SYMPTOM. Don’t reveal the cause. Tell them that you’ll soon reveal it in the webinar. Reinforce this claim with a “This is why…” followed by another detail about their experience of the SYMPTOM. For extra effect, reinforce how this SYMPTOM is an early warning sign of the coming CRISIS. 
Finish this section with an “if ___, then here’s why…” statement to transition to the next section of your webinar. 
Formula #3: Pain vs Promise 
Now use the variables and subvariables to write our webinar opening. This opening MUST be consistent with what’s in the webinar Ad/Post, and the webinar Registration Page. This opening will follow my “Pain vs Promise” formula. Pain vs promise openings contrast the pain of your prospect’s PROBLEM with the imagined pleasure of the BENEFIT. 
I discuss this technique in detail in my article below.
www.sethczerepak.com/emotional-copywriting
For example, you can use pain vs promise contrasts in headlines, like this:
Wipes Out Stabbing Foot Pain So You Can Sleep Peacefully
You can also use this technique in calls to action, like this:
If you’re to sleep peacefully again, and say goodbye to foot pain forever, click here RIGHT NOW to save 70% on your first order! 
You can also use it in your webinars, VSLs, sales pages, upsells, emails, and ad openings. In fact, if you want to master the craft of copywriting as fast as possible, I’d advise you to spend one hour a day for the next year using this technique to write only headlines, calls to action, and openings. That’s how powerful and universal this technique is. Now, here’s now to create the opening…
Start your pain vs promise opening with three questions or statements that confirm the symptoms of your prospect’s PROBLEM. Write one of these three questions to start with, "Are you..." another with,"Do you often feel…" and another with, "Have you noticed…lately..."
If applicable, tell your reader how these symptoms could increase in severity, building up to a crisis. This should be something that is likely to happen if the PROBLEM either isn't solved or is improperly treated. Make the description of this crisis as concrete, specific, and emotional as possible. After these questions, use an "if___, here’s why ___ " statement to transition to the next part of your webinar opening.
Next, introduce yourself or your presenter. As with your story opening, your introduction should be short and simple, like “My name is ___,” followed by a brief list of credentials or accomplishments is fine. Don’t overdo it.  
After your introduction, use a phrase like, “In the next ___ minutes,” or “by the end of this webinar,” to tell them that they’re about to discover why their PROBLEM is more critical, urgency than they realize. More importantly, tell them they’re about to discover why the common advice or solutions don’t solve the PROBLEM, and could even make it worse. 
You can also reveal how a commonly assumed advantage won’t help them solve the PROBLEM, unless they know the secret you’re going to reveal in your webinar. Here are some examples of such statements (I’ve bolded the assumed advantages for clarity): 
1.	“I’ll also show you why even good genetics won’t save you from putting on weight as you get older.”
2.	“You’ll also discover why even entrepreneurs who make millions a year struggle with crippling mental blocks that stop them from breaking their next income barrier.”
Next, use a phrase like “the good news is…” to assure them that they’ll also discover a “secret” that will solve their PROBLEM, deliver the BENEFIT, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
This “secret,” is a mysterious reference to your OFFER as the best SOLUTION to your prospect’s PROBLEM. You can call this “secret” a shortcut, system, habit, program, technique, framework, loophole, etc. Just make sure it clearly communicates what your OFFER does, and in a way that’s clear to your AUDIENCE. 
I also recommend you use another word, other than “best” to describe your SOLUTION as the best. Instead, use a word that tells your prospect how your OFFER solves their PROBLEM. If your OFFER delivers the result safely and quickly, you might say “the safest, quickest secret to ___.” If your OFFER is fast and powerful, and your OFFER safely delivers you might way “the fastest and most powerful way to ___.” See my “Super Seven” in Chapter XI for more details on how to position your product or service as the “best.”


 
Myth-Busting (Working) 
Webinar Myth-Busting Prompt:
Now write the Myth-Busting section of the webinar. Do it for each of the Myths I gave you earlier in this thread. This message MUST be consistent with what’s in the rest of the webinar copy. Create one of these for EACH of the MYTHS defined above, and write each MYTH one at a time, waiting for my approval before moving to the next. 
Start with a “you’ve probably heard…” or “[Expert or authority] will tell you…” or “Many people believe that…” followed by the MYTH and the outcome that the MYTH promises, but doesn’t actually (or fully) deliver.
Next, you use a “what you haven’t heard is…” or “what they won’t tell you is…” or “what most people don’t know is that…” to introduce the flaw or “catch” of the MYTH. 
Next, you use a “this is why…” statement to connect the flaw you’ve just exposed to something your AUDIENCE is likely experiencing because they believe the MYTH. You can also use something that your AUDIENCE is likely to see happening to someone else who believes the MYTH. 
How you end your myth-busting message depends on whether you’re in the middle of unpacking multiple MYTHS, or transitioning into the next part of your message. 
If you’re finishing your myth-busting and transitioning to the next part of your message (your Solution Pitch), ask a rhetorical question about what the real SOLUTION to the PROBLEM is. Here’s an example:
“So, if finding good clients isn’t just about knowing where to look, and if it’s not about building a big Social Media following, and if it’s not about writing a book, how do you find clients willing to pay 5x or 10x what they’re paying you now?”
If you’re finishing one MYTH and about to debunk the next, use one of these two approaches:  
1.	Ask whether they want to pay the price of the MYTH (or continue paying it), for example: “Do you really want to keep using shortcuts that make your sales slumps last longer than they should?”
2.	Use a metaphor, anecdote, expert quote, or joke to reinforce how pointless, irrational or ridiculous the MYTH is. 
The example below shows you the third myth of a myth-busting message, and how we’d transition to the next section. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
MYTH #3: Authorship = Authority
You’ve probably heard that becoming a published author will make you a well-respected and well-paid authority. 
What you HAVEN’T heard is that thousands of business books are written every year, many of which never get the author a lick of recognition or respect with their target market.
According to NPD Group, The self-help industry exploded by 11% from 2013 to 2019, with U.S. sales of self-help books growing annually up to 18.6 million volumes. Self-help title numbers nearly tripled during the same period, from 30,897 to 85,253. [1]
This is why, even after writing your book, you’re still attracting clients who complain about your price and who don’t understand what makes you superior or unique to your competitors. 
You’ve heard the old riddle, “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?” The new riddle of digital age authorship is, “If thousands of trees fall in the forest every day, why should anyone care about one of them?”
So, if finding good clients isn’t just about knowing where to look, and if it’s not about building a big Social Media following, and if it’s not about writing a book, how do you find clients willing to pay 5x or 10x what they’re paying you now?

VSL 
 
Ad/Post (VSL) 
Vsl Ad Prompt:
Act as a master Direct Response Copywriter and use the variables and subvariables above to write an ad promoting a VSL to the AUDIENCE defined above. Write the ad, with emojis, to have the following three sections:
1.	Attention: call out the pain or desire of your AUDIENCE.
2.	Curiosity: foreshadow the SECRET(S), MISTAKE(S), or ALTERNATIVE(S) you’ll reveal or debunk in your VSL. 
3.	Action: call the AUDIENCE to a specific and urgent action.
IMPORTANT:
●	DO NOT label the sections within the finished ad!
●	This ad should be a FINISHED Product–ready to publish, with emojis and with NO placeholders of labels or commentary. 
●	Limit your sentence length to 35 to 45 characters, and line breaks with DOUBLE spaces between each sentence. . 
As you can see, the Curiosity section of your ad will depend on which of the above four markets you’re competing in. Here’s a breakdown of how you’ll use this information to write the sections of your VSL ad. 
SECTION #1: Attention
[red, orange, or yellow emoji] Start this section with a demographic callout to your AUDIENCE, and then jump right into the part instructed below.
Make an appeal to your reader’s curiosity. I call this a “curiosity seed.” A good curiosity seed is something surprising or mysterious that: 
●	Is making (or could make) their PROBLEM worse. 
●	Is stopping (or could stop) them from solving their PROBLEM.
●	Is stopping (or could stop) them from achieving a BENEFIT.
●	Could help them solve their PROBLEM or achieve a BENEFIT faster, easier, or more effectively. 
As you can see, a curiosity seed can be a warning against something negative, or a promise of something positive. It can also be a warning or insight about something your AUDIENCE is currently doing, or thinking about doing. We’ll talk about these different angles, and when to use which, when we talk about Split Testing Emotional Needs.
You can also appeal to curiosity indirectly using a third party story, which is effective for VSLs marketing B2C Products or Services. You’ll find demonstrations of each in the four examples in this section. 
Next, ask three questions or make three statements that confirm either the PROBLEM your OFFER will solve for your AUDIENCE, the BENEFIT they want to experience, or both. 
Make one of these three questions start with, "Are you..." another with,"Do you want…" and another with, "Have you been..." These questions should reinforce the curiosity seed you made at the start of your ad. They should also be based on the market type you’re competing in. 
●	For B2C Markets, you’ll foreshadow a secret or insight to be revealed in a story. This story will be about someone who had a life-changing experience with your product or service
●	For B2B Markets, you’ll foreshadow a SECRET that will help your AUDIENCE solve their PROBLEM or achieve a BENEFIT faster, easier, or more effectively.
●	For Information Saturated Markets, you’ll foreshadow a MISTAKE that’s stopping (or could stop) your AUDIENCE from solving their PROBLEM or achieving a BENEFIT. 
●	For Product or Service Saturated Markets, you’ll foreshadow how an ALTERNATIVE solution is either failing to help them achieve a BENEFIT, failing to solve their PROBLEM, or making their PROBLEM worse. 
Next, finish this section of your ad by telling your reader that you’re about to reveal the SECRET, the MISTAKE, or the insight that you’ve made them curious about. 
Here are four examples of what the Attention section of your VSL ad might look like. I’ve included one example for each of these four market types: 
EXAMPLE #1: B2C Products and Services 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
AMAZING: This Ex-Janitor Turned His Yearly Income into His Monthly Income in Just 89 Days!
Are you still looking for a business that can replace your income? 
Have you been frustrated and let down by gimmicks and scams about making money? 
Do you want to see a real example of someone who did it in less than three months?
That’s exactly what Harold Richman did when he discovered a little known kitchen table industry where people are quietly earning tens of thousands of dollars every month. 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #2: B2B Products and Services 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
REVEALED: The #1 marketing secret for scaling from six to seven figures!
Are you stuck at the $30,000 to $50,000 a month mark?
Do you have months where you make more than $100,000, but wonder why you can’t do it consistently?
Have you tried everything from coaching, to paid ads, to podcasting, to social media, to hiring agencies, and are STILL stuck?
If so, there’s a little known, unpopular marketing secret you’ve probably never heard of… 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #3: Information Saturated Markets
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
WARNING: This bookkeeping mistake causes most IRS audits!
Do you hate paying so much of your hard-won profits to the government, when you could be investing them back into your business?
Have you been keeping your own books to save money, but secretly fear you might make a mistake?
Are you worried that if you write off the wrong expenses, you’ll get a surprise visit from the IRS?
If so, brace yourself and hope you’re not making this one…
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #4: Product or Service Saturated Market
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
ALERT: The #1 Sign of a Dangerous Detox Program
Do you STILL want a healthy and natural way to reset your gut health, but wonder if you can trust anything you read online anymore?
Have you tried detox programs and felt like you wasted your money? 
Are you starting to wonder whether detox is just another marketing gimmick?
You’ll be shocked what this 30 year fitness trainer says about the hidden danger of popular detox programs…
***********************************END************************************
These examples use three of my foundational copywriting techniques: relevance, curiosity, and breadcrumbing. 
SECTION #2: Curiosity
In this section, tell your AUDIENCE that your video reveals a surprising or shocking insight about one (or all) of the following:
●	How to solve their PROBLEM. 
●	How to achieve a BENEFIT.
●	The flaws of an ALTERNATIVE. 
Next, tell them that after watching your VSL, they'll understand how to achieve the BENEFIT or solve the PROBLEM without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. For extra effect (this is optional), tell them that they’ll finally understand why other members of the AUDIENCE seem to be succeeding while they aren’t (this is especially effective in B2C markets). 
Next, use a "Here's what you'll learn..." statement to introduce a list of bullet points describing what will be revealed in your VSL. These bullet points will be different for each of the four market types, as demonstrated in the examples below. 
Finish this section by telling your reader who the VSL is for. Use this statement to foreshadow the SOLUTION you’ll be pitching. Tie the SOLUTION to the BENEFIT your AUDIENCE will experience as a result of discovering it. 
The examples below picks up where the examples above left off.
EXAMPLE #1: B2C Products and Services 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
This FREE video reveals how a new trend in the global economy is opening doors for regular people to earn more money working for themselves than they ever could as an employee.
Here's what you'll learn from Harold's story:
[relevant emoji]How to triple weekly earning potential by turning an ordinary skill into expert specialization.
[relevant emoji]How to double weekly income in days by cutting employer overhead from the equation.  
[relevant emoji]How the simple change from self-employed to employer can 5x monthly income for anyone. 
We created this video for anyone who knows they're smart enough to make more money, but has little startup capital and wants a simple system for getting started. 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #2: B2B Products and Services 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
We’ve published a FREE video that reveals the single most powerful way to scale a business from six to seven figures, even if you’ve been stuck for years.
Here's what this video shows you…
[relevant emoji]Why the $30,000 to $50,000 a month is such a sticking point and why less than 5% of entrepreneurs ever break past it. 
[relevant emoji]How the same marketing techniques that took your business to six figures are stopping you from getting to seven. 
[relevant emoji]The crazy reason scaling from six to seven figures SHOULD happen faster, and why slow is a sign you’ll never make it.
[relevant emoji]The simple, yet hard to master marketing secret that creates 10x+ growth and why so few entrepreneurs master it. 
This video isn't for people who want quick, easy answers or who aren’t willing to work. 
But if you’re a hungry entrepreneur who is stuck at the $30,000 to $50,000 a month mark, and wants to scale from six to seven figures, this will be the most important video you’ve seen in years. 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #3: Information Saturated Markets
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
My name is Don Dollars. I’m a professional CPA who has helped thousands of small businesses pay less taxes and keep the IRS off their backs. 
I’ve created a FREE video that reveals the shocking mistakes that keep most businesses from getting these results:
[relevant emoji]They make one (or more) of three common booking mistakes that are highly likely to trigger IRS audits. 
[relevant emoji]They’re too afraid of the IRS to leverage all the write-offs available to them (I’ll reveal  three you’re probably missing). 
[relevant emoji]They’re too busy running their business to keep up with tax laws (I’ll show you a simple way around this problem). 
[relevant emoji]They hire a CPA who either doesn’t know the above things, or doesn’t have the time to apply them to their account. 
This video is for Business owners who want to keep MORE of their money and are sick of worrying about the IRS showing up at their door. 
By the time you’ve watched this video, you’ll finally understand why some businesses pay two or three times as much taxes as they legally have to. 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #4: Product or Service Saturated Market
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
We’ve created a FREE expose video that reveals the truth about whether Detox programs are the safest, most effective way to reset your health without overhauling your entire diet and lifestyle. 
Here’s what this video will show you: 
[relevant emoji]Startling scientific studies about why some detoxes are harmful to your immune system and metabolism. 
[relevant emoji]What EVERYONE should know about juice fasts, and why some people stop them midway to save their metabolism. 
[relevant emoji]The startling connection between fatigue, insomnia, brain fog and plant-based “vegan” detoxes (this will shock you). 
[relevant emoji]What more nutritionists and holistic doctors are telling their clients to do instead of detoxes, and why you should do it. 
This video reveals startling evidence that exposes the red flags of dangerous (yet popular) detox programs. 
This video will open your eyes to how men and women in their 30s and 40s REALLY reset their health, and boost their metabolism, without expensive supplements or complicated nutrition plans.  
***********************************END************************************
Notice how these four examples are similar in their format, but slightly different in their subject matter. The first one uses storytelling. 
The other three examples use a combination of relevance, curiosity, hope, and breadcrumbing to get our AUDIENCE interested in watching our VSL and discovering what impact the SECRET(S), MISTAKE(S), or ALTERNATIVE(S) will have on their ability to solve their PROBLEM and achieve the promised BENEFIT. 
SECTION #3: Action
Finish your VSL ad with an "If___, then___" statement telling your reader that the only way to satisfy their curiosity is to watch your VSL. 
Next, write a call to action that tells your reader three things:
1.	Exactly what to do.
2.	Why they need to do it.  
3.	Why they need to do it right now. 
Finish your ad with a "PS:" statement that offers a premium or bonus for taking action right now. Add some urgency to this premium or bonus like a limited time or limited supply to ensure that they take action and get it now before it's gone forever. 
Since the Action section of your VSL ad will be similar for all four market types, we’ll just look at one example.

Squeeze Page (Working) 
Squeeze Page Prompt:
Now use the variables and subvariables to write a squeeze page. The messaging on this squeeze page MUST consistent with what’s in the Ad/Post
Start the squeeze page by creating a headline that:
-	Is consistent with the message in the Webinar Ad/Post.
-	Uses “High-Value Curiosity” to entice the reader to register. 
High-Value Curiosity uses a “curiosity seed” (the point of the reader’s curiosity) to tease the reader about something that is directly connected to their ability to either solve a PROBLEM or achieve a BENEFIT:
●	Negative: making the PROBLEM worse or harder to understand to to solve.
●	Positive: Will make the BENEFIT easier to achieve, or that will magnify the speed, ease, power, durability, safety, or enjoyment of achieving it. 
The “Negative” curiosity can be stated as a myth, habit, shortcut, etc. The “Positive” curiosity seed can be a secret, shortcut, habit, etc. Both can also be something mysterious that we call by a nickname (in “quotations”). We should also give some context to the curiosity seed by telling us something about it without revealing too much about what it might be. 
Create two versions of the Registration page, one for a Negative Curiosity Seed, and another for a Positive one.  
The secret to a high-converting squeeze page is a combination of high-value curiosity and something I call the Law of One. The Law of One states that the most effective marketing messages appeal to one PROBLEM, one driving EMOTION, one SOLUTION, and one BENEFIT. The PROBLEM may have many SYMPTOMS, and the BENEFIT may have many side benefits, but the more you try to straddle multiple ideas, the more likely you are to confuse or overwhelm your prospect. 
Confusion is easily the deadliest marketing sin. This is the only thing I disagree with my mentor Dan S Kennedy about. He claims that the biggest sin is being boring. I’ll agree that’s a big one. But while bored prospects can still become buyers, confused prospects will never become buyers. 
When it comes to squeeze pages, the Law of One also applies to your call to action. I’ll show you some situations later where multiple calls to action are necessary. But your squeeze page should only give them one option: opt in, or leave. 
Your squeeze page only needs a header section, and a list of three to five bullet points. Some squeeze pages don’t even need bullet points, but you should test both variations. The header of your squeeze page should entice your prospect in one (and only one) of the following ways: 
1.	Tell them that your video reveals a SECRET (trick, shortcut, hack, etc) that will help them achieve the BENEFIT. 
2.	Tell them that your video exposes a MISTAKE that’s keeping them from achieving the BENEFIT.
3.	Tell them that your video reveals a valuable insight about an ALTERNATIVE solution to their PROBLEM. 
Notice how these relate to the Market Types we discussed in the previous section. This is how we make the message on our squeeze page consistent with what we said in our VSL ad/post. Once our headline has grabbed our prospect’s attention and created curiosity, we’ll use these four bullet point formulas to make them want to see the video on the next page.
●	Highlight the BENEFIT and why some achieve it while others don’t. Include social proof here if possible. 
●	Hint at how the SECRET(S), MISTAKE(S), or ALTERNATIVE(S) are either preventing  them from solving their PROBLEM and/or achieving the BENEFIT.
●	Foreshadow the SOLUTION to the PROBLEM. 
●	Address the reader's EXTERNAL or INTERNAL OBJECTION about the PROBLEM or SOLUTION.
Choose from the bullet point formulas on the page below to create the above bullets:
www.sethczerepak.com/copywriting-kitchen-ads
NOTE: Your first bullet point can highlight the PROBLEM and why some members of the AUDIENCE overcome it (or never have it), while others can’t seem to get rid of it. 
Let’s look at four examples, one for each of the Market Types discussed at the start of this chapter. 
EXAMPLE for Market #1 (B2C Products and Services): 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************

***********************************END************************************
Notice how this example creates high-value curiosity by teasing my prospect about some secret technique that will dramatically increase their speed and precision. I also foreshadow some mysterious habit that’s been stopping them from achieving this BENEFIT. This is how I create emotional contrast and make my prospect to think two things:
1.	“This might explain why nothing I’ve tried has worked yet.” 
2.	“Maybe this secret technique will help me play faster.”
They’ll input their information to find out if the video really delivers what I’ve promised. If it does, they’ll be much more likely to believe me when I pitch my SOLUTION and OFFER. 
EXAMPLE for Market #2 (B2B Products and Services):

***********************************END************************************
Notice how this example creates high-value curiosity by teasing my prospect about some SECRET that will help them scale from six to seven figures. The prospect will input their information to find out if the video really delivers what I’ve promised. If my VSL convinces them that this SECRET will work for them, they’ll be much more likely to believe me when I pitch my SOLUTION and OFFER. 
EXAMPLE for Market #3 (Information Saturated Markets):

***********************************END************************************
Notice again that I’ve created high-value curiosity by teasing my prospect about some mysterious MISTAKE that’s stopping them from closing more deals and making more money. The prospect will input their information to find out if this MISTAKE will explain why nothing they’ve tried has worked so far. If my VSL convinces them that fixing this MISTAKE will revolutionize their sales career and their income, they’ll be much more likely to believe me when I pitch my SOLUTION and OFFER.

***********************************END************************************ 
In this example, vegan dieting is the ALTERNATIVE solution I’m out to debunk. Notice how it creates high-value curiosity by teasing my prospect about whether vegan dieting will really help them lose fat and look and feel younger. This assumes that my AUDIENCE is either using, or considering, vegan dieting as a means to achieve this. If my VSL convinces my prospect that vegan dieting won’t help them, but actually make it harder to reach their goal, they’ll be much more likely to believe me when I pitch my SOLUTION and OFFER.

VSL Opening (Working) 
VSL Opening Prompts:
Now write our VSL opening. This opening MUST be consistent with what’s in the VSL Ad/Post, and the VSL squeeze page. It should also use the Market Type above to determine which of the Formulas below to follow. 
Market #1 Formula: B2C Products and Services 
The VSL opening for B2C markets should tell a story about someone who had a life-changing experience with your product or service. The two exceptions are if you’re marketing to an information saturated market (Market Type #3), or a market that’s saturated with a product or service (SOLUTION) like yours (Market Type #4). We’ll discuss the VSL opening formulas for these two markets later in this section. 
Start your VSL story opening with a flashback to a CRISIS that your AUDIENCE is likely to suffer if they don’t solve their PROBLEM. Use hypnotic copywriting techniques to create a “synthetic experience” in your reader’s mind. 
Transition out with a "little did I/[hero’s name] know…" statement about how the CRISIS led to the discovery of a SECRET or SOLUTION. Tell the reader that this SECRET or SOLUTION will be revealed soon in the video. 
Next, introduce yourself as the narrator, and use a “if you're watching this video, you and I are probably a lot alike..” followed by three to five damaging but REDEEMABLE ADMISSIONS about yourself. Use a “yet, despite all this…” statement to once again allude to the SECRET or SOLUTION that you’ve either discovered or created, what it’s done for you (or your clients), and a hint at what it might do for your prospect. Refer back to the story to foreshadow what came after the CRISIS. 
Follow this by a “You're here because…” statement that confirms your prospect’s desire to solve their PROBLEM and/or achieve the BENEFIT, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTIONS, and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTIONS. Finish with an “if ___, then here’s why…” statement that ends with one of these endings:
1.	…here’s why you need to [read, watch, listen to] this (entire) video all the way to the end.
2.	…[finding, attending, reading, watching, listening to] this video (to the end) [is, will be] the best decision you’ve ever made.
3.	…[finding, attending, reading, watching, listening to] this video will [suggest a categorical change in their life as a result of them watching the video].
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Ethan lay alone in a pool of his own blood. Sirens wailed closer as he gazed at flashing red and blue lights above. He could taste the iron in his blood as it filled his mouth.
“So, this is how I’m going to die?” He thought.
Suddenly, Ethan pictured his family. The cheerful faces of his two young children, and his sweet wife, Melanie. They’d be running to greet him at the door by now.
“If I never see them again, it’ll be because of those punks,” he thought, recalling the fierce eyes and jeering grins of his attackers.
Little did Ethan know that his brush with death would lead him to discover a life-changing secret that would have put his attackers in the hospital that night instead of him. A swift system of quick self-defense moves so simple, powerful, and easy, they could make you lethally dangerous to almost any attacker, and I’ll prove it to you over the next 2 minutes.
My name is Dan Powers.
If you’re listening to this message, I'm betting you and I are a lot alike. I've never been remarkably athletic. I'm not naturally fast, strong, or coordinated, and I don't even like to fight. Yet, despite all this, I've discovered and mastered a simple system of quick, highly-effective self-defense moves that I've used to train dozens of people to protect themselves against attackers bigger and stronger than them.
Ethan, the man in the story you just heard, was one of my first students, and your jaw will drop when you hear what happened just after his attack, and what he's doing now.
You’re here because you've probably been hurt in a fight and you want to make your next attacker wish they'd never seen your face. If this sounds right, here's why watching this entire video will be the most life-changing decision you've ever made...
***********************************END************************************
Notice how this example uses storytelling, hypnotic copywriting, and breadcrumbing (all explained in my two three articles below) to draw the reader in. It also ties the story to my prospect’s desire to solve their PROBLEM and achieve the BENEFIT. Most importantly, it subtly overcomes the EXTERNAL and INTERNAL OBJECTIONS by assuring my AUDIENCE that the self-defense system I’ll be revealing is simple, quick, highly-effective, and that it can work even against bigger opponents.

EXAMPLE #2: Storytelling (Financial Crisis)
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
My hands were shaking. My face flushed with hot blood as I ripped open my bank statement and stared at the lonely red print…
“Balance -.37 cents”
Rent was 7 days late. I’d given blood twice that week just to buy gas. My refrigerator was empty except for two apples, a bottle of water, and three fish oil capsules. Six months ago, I’d left a six-figure job to start my own business.
Now I had to face the giggling criticisms of everyone who had called me crazy for leaving a steady paycheck to pursue my dream.
But my crushing defeat had a silver lining. It inspired me to seek out and discover a selling strategy so simple, and so powerful, it's swept me on toward roaring success since then. And in the next two minutes, I’ll show you how this strategy will explode your personal income, even if you don’t yet have a business or know what kind of business to start.
My name is Mark Carlton.
If you’ve found this video, it's probably because you and I are a lot alike. I came from a pretty poor family. I’m not naturally smart, charismatic, or creative, and I didn't even finish high school. Yet, despite all this, I’ve escaped the nightmarish cycle of "live work, and die" to become a world-famous business coach who has helped dozens of ordinary people become multimillionaires.
The story you just heard happened to me in 2009, and you'll be shocked to hear what came next, and how I've helped several people quickly build six and seven-figure businesses since then.
You’re here because you’ve built a profitable business with a good client base, and you've even had a few five-figure months. Still, you can't seem to break the $100k a year mark and you're tired of seeing people dumber than you make more money than you. If that's the reason you're watching this video today, here's why watching it to the end will be the most important decision you've ever made...
***********************************END************************************
Notice how this example also uses storytelling, hypnotic copywriting, and breadcrumbing (all explained in my two three articles below) to draw the reader in. It also ties the story to my prospect’s desire to solve their PROBLEM and achieve the BENEFIT. Most importantly, it ties the SECRET or SOLUTION that I’ll be revealing to an end result that my AUDIENCE wants to achieve (breaking the $100k a year mark).

EXAMPLE #3: Storytelling (Social Crisis)
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
I would have crawled naked over broken glass to get off stage that night. My heart pounded and my legs shook like jackhammers as I scanned the crowd for just one friendly face. Muffled jeers rippled through the audience as I struggled to clear the lump in my throat.
For weeks, I’d huddled over that speech trying to perfect every word, every pause, every voice inflection. But as my big date approached, I couldn’t shake the needling voice of internal self-doubt. By the time I stood in front of the crowd, this voice had drowned out every other thought, and I was reduced to a stuttering, self-conscious ball of cold sweat.
Little did I know that this embarrassing moment would lead me to discover a life-changing secret. A timeless mind-calming technique that will quickly, and permanently turn you into a poised, persuasive presenter even if you’re socially awkward and terrified at the thought of speaking in public.
My name is Carl Evans.
If you've found this video, you and I are probably a lot alike. I was never popular in school. I’m not naturally charismatic, or entertaining, and I'm still pretty awkward in social situations. Yet, despite all this, I’ve become a successful speaker for one of the top marketing authorities in the world, and I routinely get standing ovations and sell hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of products every time I speak.
The story you just heard happened to me just six months before this video, and you’ll be shocked to hear what happened the next time I got on stage, and each time since then.
You’re here because you have a life-changing story to share, but can’t seem to shake the toe-curling fear that seizes you just seconds before you step in front of a crowd. If this is right, here’s why watching this video to the end will be the most important decision you’ve ever made…

EXAMPLE #4: Storytelling (Existential Crisis)
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The news hit me like a steel-toed kick in the gut. For 41 years, coaching football had been the center around which everything in my life revolved. Now, I'd lost my four decade career at the high-school where my father, grandfather, my three boys and I had graduated.
I remember walking out of the gym, past a glass-encased wall of trophies, and pictures of me with my students and players. Every one of them was a memory from a life that felt suddenly far away.
I wasn't Coach Johnson anymore. In fact, I wasn't sure who I was now, or what I'd do next. Little did I know that this sudden change would lead me to the deepest and most fulfilling career change of my life.
It started when I walked into a dusty old bookstore, pulled a 100 year old book off the shelf, and discovered an astonishing secret that every man spends his life searching for. Once you've discovered this simple secret for yourself, you'll understand why it's so important for you to watch this video to the end.
My name is Ron Johnson.
If you've come this far, you and I are probably a lot alike. I've always thought of myself as a practical and responsible man. I’m not much of a risk taker. Until five years ago, I'd never even left the continental United States or made more than $60k a year.
Today, I travel all over the world making $100k to $200k a month helping men like you to discover their life purpose and turn it into a career that rewards them with a life of deep meaning, and adventure. I often get letters from men who have read my books, and left unfulfilling careers to create six and seven figure businesses and lives of significance.
You’re here because you feel like no matter how successful you are, there's still something missing from your life. Despite all your success, you still feel like the best part of you is hiding up your sleeve. If you're ready to discover what this feeling really means, and what you can do about it, here’s why watching this entire video will be the most important decision you've ever made…
***********************************END************************************
Notice how this example also uses storytelling, hypnotic copywriting, and breadcrumbing (all explained in my two three articles below) to draw the reader in. It also ties the story to my prospect’s desire to solve their PROBLEM and achieve the BENEFIT. Most importantly, it ties the SECRET or SOLUTION that I’ll be revealing to an end result that my AUDIENCE wants to achieve (turning their purpose into a career that rewards them with a life of deep meaning, and adventure).

Market #2 Formula: B2B Products and Services 
The VSL opening for B2B markets should foreshadow the SECRET(S) that will help your AUDIENCE solve their PROBLEM and/or achieve a BENEFIT. Again, the two exceptions are if you’re marketing to an information saturated market (Market Type #3), or a market that’s saturated with a product or service (SOLUTION) like yours (Market Type #4). We’ll discuss those VSL opening formulas in the next two sections. 
Start this VSL opening with three questions or statements that confirm either the PROBLEM your OFFER will solve for your AUDIENCE, the BENEFIT they want to experience, or both. 
Make one of these three questions start with, "Are you..." another with,"Do you want…" and another with, "Have you been..." These questions should reinforce the curiosity seed you made at the start of your VSL. Foreshadow a SECRET that will help your AUDIENCE solve their PROBLEM or achieve a BENEFIT faster, easier, or more effectively.
Next, use an “If you answered YES to any of these questions…” statement followed by one of these transitions to the next statement: 
1.	…this video will save you [time, energy, stress, etc.] by revealing [#] [adjective here] SECRET(S) that [impact of SECRET or anticipation of your prospect’s response to it].
2.	…[finding, attending, reading, watching, listening to] this video will save you [time, energy, stress, etc.] by revealing [#] [adjective here] SECRET(S) that [impact of SECRET(S) or anticipation of listener’s response to it].
3.	…[finding, attending, reading, watching, listening to] this video will [foreshadow how they’ll save time, energy, money, and hassle by what they’re about to learn].
If applicable, give yourself a brief introduction as the speaker in the video. Follow this introduction with a statement like this:
In [short time frame here], I’m going to show you (the ___ truth about) how [high achieving members of the AUDIENCE ] (REALLY) [statement about achieving BENEFIT]( without [EXTERNAL OBJECTION(S)])(, even if/when [INTERNAL OBJECTION(S)]), and [statement confirming how the same will happen for them once they know and/or apply the SECRET(S) themselves].
Finish your opening with a “These/ This SECRET(S) is/are so [simple, powerful, fast, etc] ] that not only…” [reference to them achieving the BENEFIT], but [reference to the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional payoff of achieving the BENEFIT](without [EXTERNAL OBJECTION]) in/by [TIME/DEADLINE] and [statement confirming that they’ll understand AND believe in the above PROMISE the moment they hear these SECRET(S) themselves].

Are you looking for a quick, healthy, painless, and practical way to drop fat and firm up your midsection, and are you frustrated with conflicting diet and workout advice from people who all claim to have the science on their side?
Have you been wondering how some men still look lean, strong, vibrant, and healthy even into their 50s, 60s, and 70s?
Do you want to feel healthy, energized, focused, and to look great without committing the next 12 months to a strict diet program, and without spending part time job hours at the gym?

Market #3 Formula: Information Saturated
The VSL opening formula for information saturated markets should foreshadow the MISTAKE(S) keeping your AUDIENCE from solving their PROBLEM and/or achieving a BENEFIT. 
Start this opening with three questions or statements that confirm either the PROBLEM your OFFER will solve for your AUDIENCE, the BENEFIT they want to experience, or both. 
Make one of these three questions start with, "Are you..." another with,"Do you want…" and another with, "Have you been..." These questions should reinforce the curiosity seed you made at the start of your VSL. Foreshadow a MISTAKE that’s stopping your AUDIENCE (or slowing them down) from solving their PROBLEM or achieving a BENEFIT.
Next, use an “If you answered YES to any of these questions…” statement followed by one of these transitions to the next statement. 
1.	…this video will save you [time, energy, stress, etc.] by revealing [#] [adjective here] MISTAKE(S) that [impact of MISTAKE(S) or anticipation of your prospect’s response to it].

Market #4 Formula: Product or Service Saturated
The VSL opening formula for information saturated markets should tell your AUDIENCE that you’re about to reveal the truth about whether certain ALTERNATIVE(S) will help them solve their PROBLEM and/or achieve the BENEFIT. 
Start this opening with three questions or statements that confirm either the PROBLEM your OFFER will solve for your AUDIENCE, the BENEFIT they want to experience, or both. 
Make one of these three questions start with, "Are you..." another with,"Do you want…" and another with, "Have you been..." These questions should reinforce the curiosity seed you made at the start of your VSL. Foreshadow how you’ll be exposing the truth about the ALTERNATIVE(S) that AUDIENCE might be using (or thinking about using) to solve their PROBLEM or achieve the BENEFIT.
Next, use an “If you answered YES to any of these questions…” statement followed by one of these transitions to the next statement. 
1.	…this video will save you [time, energy, stress, etc.] by revealing [#] [adjective here] ALTERNATIVE(S) that [impact of ALTERNATIVE(S) or anticipation of your prospect’s response to what they’re about to learn about it/them].

OPTIONAL: Use an “In fact..” statement to tell your AUDIENCE that their attempts to use one specific ALTERNATIVE is making (or could make) things worse.
Finish your opening with a statement like this one: 
[Luckily, Thankfully, The good news is], [I’m also going to share with you OR you’re also about to discover] a [fast, easy, powerful, etc] (“[NICKNAME]”) [shortcut, trick, hack, secret, habit, loophole] that not only [statement about delivering the PROMISE], but [reference to the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional payoff of achieving the BENEFIT], without [EXTERNAL OBJECTION], [even if, and it works no matter how] [INTERNAL OBJECTION].

Indoctrination (Working) 
Indoctrination Prompt:
Now use the variables and subvariables to write our VSL Indoctrination message. This message MUST be consistent with what’s in the VSL Ad/Post, squeeze page, and opening above. It should also use the Market Type above to determine which of the Formulas below to follow. 
Market #1 Formula: Any
If we’re creating an indoctrination message for Market #1, Ask me to pick whether I want the Indoctrination section to reveal a secret (or multiple secrets), exposing a mistake (or multiple mistakes), or debunk an alternative solution (or multiple alternatives). Once you have my answer, use my answer to decide which of these formulas (below) to use.  
Market #2 Formula: Secrets Revealed 
Start (or continue) this section of your VSL by numbering and naming the SECRET.
Use one of the following statement types to confirm your AUDIENCE’S experience with the PROBLEM, and/or their desire to achieve the BENEFIT, and/or their suspicions about why they're struggling while others are succeeding:
1.	TIE DOWN: “Haven’t you noticed ___” or “You’ve seen ___, haven’t you?”
2.	IF ___, THEN ___: “If [reference to other AUDIENCE members getting the result, then how come you’re [reference to prospect not getting the result]?”
3.	METAPHOR: “Is scaling your business starting to feel like pushing a rock up a slippery mountain?”
4.	CAUSE/EFFECT: “Does it seem like every time your business starts growing, you hit a long sales slump?”
Next, cite a credible source and follow it with a short statement from the source about how the SECRET is the real way to solve the PROBLEM and/or achieve the BENEFIT. For extra effect, summarize the source’s claim by contrasting the SECRET with a common MYTH, like this: 
●	According to [source], it's not [MYTH], but [SECRET] that [statement about solving the PROBLEM or achieving the BENEFIT].
●	According to [source], it's [SECRET], not [MYTH] that [statement about solving the PROBLEM or achieving the BENEFIT].
●	According to [source], it's not [MYTH] that[statement about solving the PROBLEM or achieving the BENEFIT]. It’s [SECRET].
Next, use a statement like the one below support the above claim:
This is a [“surprising discovery…” OR “startling new fact…”], if you’re [statement about being frustrated, distracted, or deceived by the MYTH OR by a lack of satisfactory results]. It [proves, reveals, exposes, explains] [statement about either what's possible with the SECRET OR a statement that explains/ justifies your prospect’s past and/or current frustrations trying to solve the PROBLEM or achieve the BENEFIT].
Next, cite another credible source and follow it with a short statement that proves the SECRET and/or busts the MYTH. Include an explicit reference to an impact (physical, financial, social, or emotional) of the SECRET and/or the MYTH that your AUDIENCE can nod their head to. 
Support this impact claim with a direct quote or example from the above mentioned source. 
Next, use a transition like “And that’s [“not all..” or “just the beginning”], followed by another statement from one of the above sources, or a new source, to foreshadow a “bonus” impact of the SECRET, and how it can solve the PROBLEM or deliver the PROMISE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Next, use a metaphor, anecdote, fable or an analogy that explains why or how the SECRET works. Include a supporting quote from one of their spiritual or political heroes of your AUDIENCE to support or clarify this explanation.
OPTIONAL: include a summary or quote from one more credible data source that proves the SECRET and/or busts the MYTH. 
How you end your indoctrination message depends on whether you’re in the middle of unpacking multiple SECRET, or transitioning into the next part of your message. 
If you’re revealing your final SECRET and transitioning to the next part of your message (your Solution Pitch), ask a rhetorical question about how to apply the SECRETS to solve the PROBLEM and to achieve the BENEFIT. 
For example, “Now you know the three biggest secrets to attracting clients who will pay you $50,000 to $100,000 a year. But how do you combine the speed, power, and efficiency of ALL these secrets, and land your first $100,000 client in the next 90 days?”
If you’re finishing one SECRET and about to reveal the next, use a “Are you starting to [see, know, understand, realize, etc]...” statement followed by one of the following endings:
1.	Reference to their past failure(s) to solve the PROBLEM and/ or achieve the BENEFIT.
2.	Invitation to imagine the possibility of finally solving the PROBLEM, achieving the BENEFIT, and enjoying all the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional, payoffs.  
3.	A combination of the above two statements, the first one followed by the second one. 
The example below assumes that you’ll have other SECRETS to reveal after the first one. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Secret #1: People Don't Buy Big Ideas. They Buy Solutions to Problems
Ever wonder why best ideas have been ignored or even rejected by the marketplace? Ever wonder why people dumber than you are making more money than you selling what seem like ordinary products and services?
This is because people don't buy big ideas. They buy solutions to problems.
This is why people are ignoring your best ideas. It's because your ideas either don't solve a problem or they aren't being marketed as solutions to a problem.
Ever notice how some of the most successful solo entrepreneurs became mega millionaires selling an ordinary product? McDonald's did it by selling hamburgers. William Wrigley Jr did it selling sticks of gum. Mary Kay Ash took an ordinary skin care cream and put her name on it. Bill Gates created the first version of Microsoft software by repurposing ordinary software he got from someone else. Most successful businesses aren't built on big ideas. They're built on thoughtful and strategic service to human needs.
This is why nothing you've done so far has worked and you keep running out of money before you get any traction.
According to Investopedia, startups fail because they either run out of money, are in the wrong market, haven't done the market research, or because of ineffective marketing.
If you're frustrated that you keep running out of money before your business idea takes off, now you know why. And that’s just the beginning...
Research from Jim Collins, published in his book "How The Mighty  Fall," reveals that the most successful and fast growing companies of the 20th Century fell into bankruptcy or obscurity because they started overinnovating by dumping time, money, and marketing efforts into big ideas instead of staying committed to solving the problems they'd become famous for solving.
You've heard the saying that a great salesperson can sell ice to an Eskimo. The hidden lesson in that old joke is that Eskimo's don't buy ice for one simple reason. They don't need it because it doesn't solve a relevant, critical, and urgent problem for them.
Today, nearly half of all new startups fail because there was no need in the market for what they were selling. This doesn't include startups that failed because their marketing failed to position the product as the solution to a problem.
The good news is that now you can use this Secret to make your next business venture wildly successful, and it can happen faster and with far less money and frustration. Just imagine how it will feel to finally become one of those success stories that most people only get to read about. Now you can.

Market #3 Formula: Mistakes Exposed 
Start (or continue) this section of your VSL by numbering and naming the MISTAKE.
Use one of the following statement types to confirm your AUDIENCE’S experience with the PROBLEM, and/or their desire to achieve the BENEFIT, and/or their suspicions about why they're struggling while others are succeeding:
1.	TIE DOWN: “Haven’t you noticed ___” or “You’ve seen ___, haven’t you?”
2.	IF ___, THEN ___: “If [reference to other AUDIENCE members getting the result, then how come you’re [reference to prospect not getting the result]?”
3.	METAPHOR: “Is scaling your business starting to feel like pushing a rock up a slippery mountain?”
4.	CAUSE/EFFECT: “Does it seem like every time your business starts growing, you hit a long sales slump?”
Follow this by a statement confirming how their suspicions are valid. Name, or describe the mistake. Then, use an “Ever notice how..” or “Think about the last time you…” or a question like”How many times have you…” to paint a picture in their imagination of how the MISTAKE has been sabotaging them. Follow this by a question drawing their attention to a physically, financially, socially, and/or emotionally painful detail of this outcome. Then, use a “This is because…” statement that tells them how the MISTAKE caused that pain. 
Next, use a “This is why…” statement followed by an explanation of why or how the MISTAKE is the reason nothing they’ve tried has worked so far. 
Next, cite a credible source and follow it with a short statement from the source about how the MISTAKE keepings members of the AUDIENCE from solving the PROBLEM and/or achieving the BENEFIT. For extra effect, summarize the source’s claim by contrasting the MISTAKE with a yet unrevealed SECRET: 
●	According to [source], it's not [MISTAKE], but [vague reference to SECRET or SOLUTION]that [statement about solving the PROBLEM or achieving the BENEFIT].
●	According to [source], [MISTAKE] not only [statement about the MISTAKE not solving the PROBLEM or delivering the BENEFIT], but it [statement about hidden impact or side-effect of the MISTAKE and its physical, financial, social, and/or emotional impact].
●	According to [source], it's not [MISTAKE] that [statement about solving the PROBLEM or achieving the BENEFIT]. It’s [SECRET]. It’s [vague reference to SECRET or SOLUTION]
Next, use a statement like the one below support the above claim:
This is a [“surprising discovery…” OR “startling new fact…”], if you’re [statement about being frustrated, distracted, or deceived by the [MISTAKE] OR by a lack of satisfactory results]. It [proves, reveals, exposes, explains] [statement about either what's possible with the SECRET OR a statement that explains/ justifies your prospect’s past and/or current frustrations in trying to solve the PROBLEM or achieve the BENEFIT].
Next, cite another credible source and follow it with a short statement from the source that proves the impact of the MISTAKE. Include an explicit reference to some physical, financial, social, and/or emotional pain of the MISTAKE that your AUDIENCE can nod their head to. 
Support this impact claim with a direct quote or example from the above mentioned source. 
Next, use a transition like “And that’s [“not all..” or “just the beginning”], followed by another statement from one of the above sources, or a new source, to foreshadow a hidden and more serious impact of the MISTAKE, and why it keeps people from solving the PROBLEM or from achieving the BENEFIT. This statement might also explain why the EXTERNAL OBJECTION stops other members of the AUDIENCE from solving the PROBLEM or achieving the BENEFIT, or confirming their fear about the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Next, use a metaphor, anecdote, fable or an analogy that explains why or why the MISTAKE has the impact it does and/or why so many people keep making it or even teaching it. Include a supporting quote from one of their spiritual or political heroes of your AUDIENCE to support or clarify this explanation.
OPTIONAL: include a summary or quote from one more credible data source that proves the above claims about the MISTAKE and/or the SECRET. 
How you end your indoctrination message depends on whether you’re in the middle of unpacking multiple MISTAKES, or transitioning into the next part of your message. 
If you’re exposing your final MISTAKE and transitioning to the next part of your message (your Solution Pitch), ask a rhetorical question about what the real SOLUTION to the PROBLEM is. For example, you might say:
“So, if finding good clients isn’t just about knowing where to look, and if it’s not about building a big Social Media following, and if it’s not about writing a book, how do you find clients willing to pay 5x or 10x what they’re paying you now?”
If you’re finishing one MISTAKE and about to expose the next, use a “Are you starting to [see, know, understand, realize, etc]...” statement followed by one of these endings:
1.	Reference to their past failure(s) to solve the PROBLEM and/ or achieve the BENEFIT.
2.	Invitation to imagine the possibility of finally solving the PROBLEM, achieving the BENEFIT, and enjoying all the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional, payoffs.  
3.	A combination of the above two statements, the first one followed by the second one. 
Finish with a statement that starts with “The good news is…” followed by a suggestion that fixing, replacing, or avoiding the MISTAKE will help them solve the PROBLEM and achieve the BENEFIT, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite (“even if___”) the INTERNAL OBJECTION.  
You can also substitute the suggestion about fixing the mistake with a foreshadowing of some SECRET or SOLUTION that deliver the PROMISE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite (“even if___”) the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
The example below assumes that you’ll have other MISTAKES to expose after the first one.

Mistake #1: Believing in Big Ideas Instead of Solving Problems
Ever wonder why best ideas have been ignored or even rejected by the marketplace? Ever wonder why people dumber than you are making more money than you selling what seem like ordinary products and services?

Market #4 Formula: Alternatives Debunked
Before we unpack this formula, let me make a clear distinction between ALTERNATIVE solutions and direct competitors. Direct competitors offer a product or service in the same category as yours. You deal with direct competitors in your Offer Positioning, which we’ll cover in the next chapter. ALTERNATIVES are products, services, or do it yourself solutions that are not within your product or service category. 
Start with a “you’ve probably heard…” or “[Expert or authority] will tell you…” or “Many people believe that…” or “You’ve probably tried…” or “Maybe you’re wondering if…” or “Promoter of [ALTERNATIVE] will tell you…” followed by the PROMISE that the ALTERNATIVE is delivers, or is supposed to deliver but does not.
Next, you use a “what you haven’t heard is…” or “what they won’t tell you is…” or “what most people don’t know is that…” to introduce the flaw or “catch” of the ALTERNATIVE. 
Next, you use a “this is why…” statement to connect the flaw you’ve just exposed to something your AUDIENCE is either experiencing or likely to experience when using the ALTERNATIVE. You can also use something that your AUDIENCE is likely to see OR hear about happening to someone else using the ALTERNATIVE. 
How you end your debunking message depends on whether you’re in the middle of debunking multiple ALTERNATIVES, or transitioning into the next part of your message. 
If you’re debunking your final ALTERNATIVE and transitioning to the next part of your message (your Solution Pitch), ask a rhetorical question about what the real SOLUTION to the PROBLEM is. For example, you might say: 
“So, if hiring a marketing agency won’t help you find good clients, and if it’s not about building a big Social Media following, and if hiring a publishing agency for your book, how do you find clients willing to pay 5x or 10x what they’re paying you now?”
If you’re finishing one ALTERNATIVE and about to debunk the next, use one of these two approaches:  
1.	Soft Approach: Ask whether they want to pay the price of the ALTERNATIVE (or continue paying it), for example: “Do you really want to keep working with ad agencies who stick their heads in the sand when your lead campaigns stop working?”
2.	Indirect Approach: Use a quote from one of your AUDIENCE’S spiritual, cultural, or political heroes to finish debunking the ALTERNATIVE. You can also tie this quote off by adding the Soft Approach above. 
3.	Aggressive Approach: Use a metaphor, anecdote or joke which proves how slow, convoluted, ineffective, dangerous, short-lived, unpleasant, or awkward (reverse of the “Super Seven” covered in Chapter XI) the ALTERNATIVE is. 
The example below assumes that you’ll have other ALTERNATIVES to debunk after this one. 
NOTE: If you’re in a product saturated market where trust is also low, you can get away with attacking or even ridiculing ALTERNATIVE solutions. However, be very careful when debunking do-it-yourself solutions in such markets. Your AUDIENCE is already primed to distrust you, and might even take this as an insult to their intelligence and ability to solve the problem themselves (even if it’s truly a bad idea for them to try). Use the Soft Approach or Indirect Approach above to debunk do-it-yourself solutions as a helpful friend who is trying to help them avoid the pitfalls of doing it on their own. You can also use the MISTAKES formula from the previous section to debunk DIY ALTERNATIVES in a product saturated market.  
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
You've probably seen ads that promise you hundreds of inbound coaching leads using a "Proven System." What they don't tell you is that their so-called "Proven System" isn't a proven system at all. It's either something they learned from an ebook or copied from someone else on the internet.
If you want evidence of this go to any freelance hiring site. You'll find at least a dozen cheap job postings from people hiring writers to create ebooks or marketing courses so they can position themselves as marketing experts.
These jobs pay meager rates of less than $10 an hour and are often done by people living in third world countries who work for $5 an hour. What are the odds that a writer working for $5 an hour has a Proven Marketing System that makes them hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year?
And would someone with a proven money making system need to hire a 3rd World writer to create it for them for only $5 an hour?
This is why you see ads everywhere now that promise to pack your coaching calendar using a Proven System while more coaches and consultants are being burned by self-proclaimed marketing experts and agencies who promise steak but deliver nothing but the sound of it sizzling.
You and I know the saying about wolves in sheep's clothing and how we'll know them by their fruits. Likewise you'll know a real expert not by whether they can use the words "Proven" and "System" in the same sentence.
You and I both know that real experts are only made by years in the trenches, by their ability to produce consistent results year after year and their ability to know the difference between truth and BS.
Do these Rubber Chicken Marketers really deserve another minute of your attention, let alone your trust, and your money?
***********************************END************************************
Notice how this example debunks the ALTERNATIVE and foreshadows a SOLUTION while using breadcrumbing (explained in my article below), to make my AUDIENCE eager to hear how they can apply the SOLUTION and enjoy all the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional payoffs of my coming PROMISE and OFFER.  


 
Solution Category (Working) 
Solution Pitch Prompts:
IMPORTANT: Remember that the SOLUTION is NOT the same thing as our OFFER. Rather, the SOLUTION represents the category to which our product or service belongs. It can also represent the larger idea that our product or service is based on. To confirm this, please tell me what the SOLUTION is that we’ll be pitching, and get me to approve, or correct, you before continuing with this prompt. 
Element #1: Introduction
Start this section with a “You could…” statement that lays out the high physical, financial, social, and/or emotional cost of either:
1.	Doing nothing and hoping things will get better. 
2.	Continuing to believe the MYTHS you just debunked.
3.	Trying to apply the SECRETS on their own. 
4.	Repeating the MISTAKES you just exposed.
5.	Trying the ALTERNATIVES you just debunked. 
Then, contrast this with a statement that foreshadows your SOLUTION as the best (see my “Super Seven” from Chapter XI) way to solve the PROBLEM and achieve the BENEFIT by a specific DEADLINE without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
You could buy a few marketing books, read some blogs, watch some YouTube videos, and hope the people you’re listening to actually know how to scale a seven figure business. 
This could take years of trial and error, and you’ll probably burn up at least $100k on ads, information products, overpriced seminars and workshops, complicated software programs, and ad agencies that just take your money and leave you exactly where you were when you hired them. 
Or, you can do what dozens of other smart entrepreneurs have done to explode their monthly income far past $100k in six months or less. And they did this without building new products or funnels, and with less than $500 a month in ad spend to start with. How did they do it? They hired a Direct Response Marketing Coach. 
***********************************END************************************
Element #2: Explain What It Is
Start this section with a clear definition of your SOLUTION, using the name it’s commonly known by. Don’t try to be clever or mysterious here. When introducing your SOLUTION, the goal is clarity, not curiosity. 
After defining the SOLUTION, add a statement telling your AUDIENCE about an additional feature or service that your SOLUTION sometimes offers, but not always. This will be important for your Offer Positioning later on. 
Next, give evidence of some results your SOLUTION is already getting for other members of your AUDIENCE. Don’t appeal to your prospect’s emotions here. Give objective data from as credible a source as possible, and make it a third party source. 
Most importantly, give them examples and data that prove your type of product or service as the superior SOLUTION for solving their PROBLEM and achieving the BENEFIT. Don’t promote your specific product or service yet! That’s what your Offer Positioning is for. 
Next, make a statement that ties the abovementioned evidence to your prospect, using “you” language (see the example below). Quantify these potential results by giving your prospect a DEADLINE and use “without [EXTERNAL OBJECTION(S)]...” and “even if [INTERNAL OBJECTION(S)]...” statements to overcome your AUDIENCE’S objections about the SOLUTION. 
Finish with a “Can you imagine…” or “What would happen if…” or “How would your [life, business, marriage, career] change if…” to put the results or examples mentioned above into a personal context for your prospect (see the final paragraph of the example below). Tie this off with a “Here’s why this is just a [glimpse, taste, etc] of what [SOLUTION] could do for you…” as a transition into your “WHY” section. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
A Direct Response Marketing Coach is a marketing expert and strategist who finds the opportunities in your business that have the most immediate and dramatic potential for increasing your leads, sales, and profits. 
An experienced Direct Response Marketing Coach will even help you develop and implement a plan for leveraging those opportunities in the shortest time possible. 
Entrepreneurs who hire Direct Response Marketing Coaches often see a doubling or tripling of their leads, 30%, 50%, or even 100%, 200%, or 300% increase in their conversions, and up to 3x, 5x, or even 10x increases in revenue. 
These dramatic results can come within 30 to 90 days, and without spending any more money on advertising, even if your business has been struggling for years and you feel like you’ll never break your current income plateau. 
What would happen in your business if, just 90 days from now, you had twice the leads, double the conversions, and 3x, 5x, or 10x the profits you’re making now? Here’s why this is just a glimpse of what hiring a Direct Response Marketing Coach could do for you…
***********************************END************************************
Element #3: Explain WHY It Works
Start this section with an “anti positioning” statement by telling the reader what the SOLUTION doesn’t do. This statement should set it apart from ALTERNATIVE solutions and give a subtle suggestion that some providers of the SOLUTION are better (see my Super Seven in Chapter XI) than others (i.e., “a good [SOLUTION]....” or “the right [SOLUTION]...” or “a [fast, easy, safe, effective, experienced, etc] [SOLUTION], etc). 
Follow this by briefly summarizing how the SOLUTION solves the PROBLEM and delivers the PROMISE in a way that the ALTERNATIVES can’t. If you’re selling an information product, make sure you don’t give away so much that your prospect thinks they can get the result on their own. Finish this section with a “This is why…” statement that assures your prospect their money will be well spent on the SOLUTION. You can also include a “This is why…” statistic showing how other members of your AUDIENCE use the SOLUTION. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
A good Direct Response Marketing Coach doesn’t advise you based on trends, hunches, or rumors about what’s worked in the past. 
They look at the hard data on how your ads, lead capture offers, sales pages, checkout pages, upsells, emails, and other marketing campaigns are performing. 
They use this data to create strategies that get measurable results, and they measure success based on how many customers they get you, and how much money they help you make. 
This is why you can be 100% confident that your investment in hiring a Direct Response Marketing Coach will pay for itself many times over. 
***********************************END************************************
Element #4: Use a Metaphor to Clarify It
Use a metaphor to clarify what your SOLUTION is and how it solves your prospect’s PROBLEM and delivers the PROMISE. If possible, use a metaphor that also overcomes the EXTERNAL and/or INTERNAL OBJECTIONS. This statement should give a subtle suggestion that some providers of the SOLUTION are better (see my Super Seven in Chapter XI) than others (i.e., “a good [SOLUTION]....” or “the right [SOLUTION]...” or “a [fast, easy, safe, effective, experienced, etc] [SOLUTION], etc). 
Finish this section with a “Can you imagine…” or “What would happen…” or a “How would your ____ change if…” question that ties your SOLUTION to the metaphor and gets your prospect to imagine what it might be like to use the SOLUTION themselves. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Hiring a Direct Response Marketing Coach is like hiring a highly specialized personal trainer and nutrition scientist. Someone who combines scientific data about your age, body type, metabolism, and gender to create a personalized nutrition plan and workout schedule for accelerating fat loss, and promoting muscle growth and peak conditioning, without spending more time in the gym than you are now. 
The difference is that a Direct Response Marketing Coach helps you get more customers and make more money. 
How much faster could you achieve your business goals if you had someone like this examining your marketing strategies, making suggestions based on hard data, and drawing on decades of specialized knowledge and experience to help you get more customers and make more money?
***********************************END************************************
Element #5: Explain Its Long-Term Impact
Tell your prospect three to five ways your SOLUTION will have a lasting impact in their life, even after they’re done using it. If these long term impacts require your prospect to continue using your SOLUTION, make that clear. This statement should give a subtle suggestion that some providers of the SOLUTION are better (see my Super Seven in Chapter XI) than others (i.e., “a good [SOLUTION]....” or “the right [SOLUTION]...” or “a [fast, easy, safe, effective, experienced, etc] [SOLUTION], etc). 
Finish this section with a “This is why…” or “This makes…” statement that assures your prospect that investing in the SOLUTION is one of the [best, smartest, etc] decisions they’ll ever make. You can also include a “This is why…” statistic showing how other members of your AUDIENCE choose the SOLUTION for lasting results. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
A good Direct Response Marketing Coach gathers key psychographic data about why your customers buy. They also help you build systems for quickly and objectively troubleshooting your marketing campaigns so you can improve their performance yourself. This makes hiring a Direct Response Marketing Coach the smartest long term investment you’ll ever make into growing your business. 
***********************************END************************************
Element #6: Share Expert Endorsements
Tell your prospect about 1-5 experts who have endorsed your SOLUTION. These can also be experts who have endorsed the idea your SOLUTION is based on, or a feature/ingredient of your type of product. I call the latter a surrogate endorsement. Confirm this with an “If it did this for them, (can you) imagine what it will do for you…” question or statement, as in the example below. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Legendary millionaire entrepreneurs like Dan S Kennedy, Gary Halbert, Mike Dillard, Grant Cardone, and Russel Brunson have relied on Direct Response Marketing to make themselves tens of millions of dollars in personal income. Imagine what will happen when you put the power of Direct Response Marketing to work in your business. 
***********************************END************************************
Element #7: Share Peer Testimonials
Give a statistic about members of your AUDIENCE who either use or have used, endorsed, or benefitted from your SOLUTION. These can also be people who have used, endorsed, or benefitted from the idea your SOLUTION is based on, or a feature/ingredient of your type of product. 
Strengthen this claim with a statement about how these people benefitted from the SOLUTION without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and/or despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. Confirm this with an “If it did this for them, (can you) imagine what it will do for you…” question or statement, as in the example below. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Hundreds of thousands of self-made millionaire entrepreneurs became rich using Direct Response Marketing. 
Many of them were broke when they started using it, and some of them had experimented with dozens of other marketing theories before discovering the power of Direct Response. 
This is just a preview of what Direct Response Marketing will do for your business, your income, and your life.
***********************************END************************************
Element #8: Explain Its Time Era Relevance
Start with a statement about how using your SOLUTION is either still important today, or more important today than it’s ever been. Use a “This is because…” statement followed by some obvious things that are happening right now that are either:
1.	Making it harder to solve the PROBLEM and achieve the BENEFIT without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and/or despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION.  
2.	Flooding the marketplace with ALTERNATIVE solutions that are either dangerous, misleading, or ineffective for solving the PROBLEM and/or delivering the BENEFIT.
End with another statement about how using your SOLUTION is either still important today, or more important today than it’s ever been. For extra effect, finish with a statement about solving PROBLEM and achieving the BENEFIT without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and/or despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION (see the example below).  
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Working with a seasoned Direct Response Marketing Coach is more important today than it’s ever been. Every day, thousands of self-proclaimed marketing experts are throwing their hat into the coaching or consulting ring, hoping to get their fingers in the pie of this rapidly growing multibillion dollar industry. 
Truly experienced and competent Direct Response Marketing experts are becoming harder to find, and it’s getting easier and easier to waste your time and money hiring the wrong person. This is why it's more important than ever to hire a seasoned marketing expert who knows how to get you more customers and grow your business, without guessing, even if your business has been stagnant for years. 
***********************************END************************************
Element #9: Expose a Flaw (X FACTOR)
The purpose of this final element is to set our prospect up for our Offer Positioning, which will come next. We’re warning our prospect of a flaw in the general SOLUTION (product or service type) so we can tell them how our specific brand of the product or service either fixes or compensates for this flaw. 
Start this section with a statement about either the side-effects of the SOLUTION or a warning that some brands or variations of the SOLUTION are flawed in some way (slow, overly complicated, ineffective, weak, short-lasting, dangerous, uncomfortable, boring, awkward, etc). Ideally, this flaw and its impact should magnify your prospect’s INTERNAL OBJECTION (not to be confused with the EXTERNAL OBJECTION…that will backfire on you!). 
Next, use a “This could cost you…” type of statement to connect the flaw you’ve just exposed to something your AUDIENCE is either experiencing or likely to experience when using the SOLUTION. You can also use something that your AUDIENCE is likely to see OR hear about happening to someone else using the SOLUTION. 
Don’t overdo this, or you’ll poison your prospect’s view of the SOLUTION and make it less likely that they’ll want your brand of it! 
Instead, prepare your prospect for your Offer Positioning (covered in the next chapter), with a statement like “Thankfully…” or “The Good news is…” followed by a hint at how your prospect can use the SOLUTION to solve their PROBLEM and achieve the BENEFIT by a specific (or estimated if necessary) DEADLINE, despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The risk of hiring a Direct Response Marketing Coach is that you might hire someone who learned most of what they know from books, seminars, and online courses. You might also hire someone who says they understand Direct Response Marketing, but who doesn’t really understand how to do it.
This could cost you weeks, or even months, of time wasted on marketing gimmicks that don’t work, and it could even hurt your reputation with potential clients or customers. 
Thankfully, there’s a secret to spotting these imposters and finding a Direct Response Marketing Coach who will explode your customer base, and increase your income and profits in the next 30 days, even if you’ve been stuck in a sales slump and feel like you’ve tried everything

Trip-Wire 
 
Ad/Post (Trip-Wire) 
 Trip-Wire Ad Prompt:
Write an ad promoting a Trip-Wire funnel. Write the ad to have the following three sections:
1.	Attention: call out the pain or desire of your AUDIENCE.
2.	Offer: describe your No-Brainer Offer and what it does. 
3.	Action: call the AUDIENCE to a specific and urgent action.
IMPORTANT:
●	DO NOT label the sections within the finished ad!
●	This ad should be a FINISHED Product–ready to publish, with emojis and with NO placeholders of labels or commentary. 
●	Limit your sentence length to 35 to 45 characters, and line breaks with DOUBLE spaces between each sentence. 
Here’s a breakdown how to write each of these sections of your ad:
SECTION #1: Attention
[red, orange, or yellow emoji] Start this section with a demographic callout to your AUDIENCE, and then jump right into the part instructed below.
There are a lot of ways to open an ad, but I’ll give you three that I’ve found to have the most long-standing effectiveness: 
●	Option #1: Question w/Contrast
Ask a question that contrasts their PROBLEM with their desire to solve it and to experience the PROMISE your OFFER delivers. 
This question can start with a positive hook like, "Do you want…" or "Have you decided…" or "Are you ready…" or “What if you could…” or “How would you like…” and follow it with a contrasting negation that addresses their INTERNAL or EXTERNAL OBJECTION. 
You can also start this question with a negative hook like,  “Are you tired of…” or “Do you want to stop (get rid of)…” or “Is [PROBLEM], [NEGATIVE IMPACT]...” and follow it with a contrasting positive statement about the PROMISE your OFFER delivers. 
NOTE: CHOOSE THE OPTION WHICH BEST FITS THE AUDIENCE AND OFFER
●	Option #2: Future Pacing
Use an opening like “imagine” or “picture” or “How would your…” or “How would you feel if…” or “What would your…” or “What would you do/think if…”  to trigger an image in your reader’s imagination. This is called “future pacing.”
●	Option #3: If [PROMISE], then [RESPONSE]
Use an opening like “If I [PROMISE]...” or “If you [PROMISE]...” followed by either a call to action, a question that tests their interest, or an impression you want them to get. 
For example, this opening finishes with a call to action:
“If you want to add $10,000 to your monthly income this week, here’s why you should read this book…”
This opening finishes with a question that tests their interest:
“If I showed you how to add $10,000 to your monthly income this week, would you be interested?”
And this opening finishes with an impression I want them to get:
“If you’re ready to add $10,000 to your monthly income this week, this will be the most important book you’ve bought all in years.”
EXAMPLE #1a: Question w/Contrast (Positive First)
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Do you want to squat and deadlift more, but you’re worried about hurting your back again? 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #1b: Question w/Contrast (Negative First)
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Want to get rid of foot pain so you can enjoy running again? 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #2: Future Pacing
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Imagine walking into your house and being greeted by the woman of your dreams and your three beautiful children. Picture this becoming your life in the next five years. 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #3: If [PROMISE], then [RESPONSE]
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
If you’re sick of struggling to find leads for your business, this will be the most important book you’ve ever read. 
***********************************END************************************
Notice how short and simple these openings are. This is because Stage #3 Prospects are already eager to solve their PROBLEM and achieve the BENEFIT you’re promising. What they really want to know is whether they can trust you to deliver. If you spend too much time talking about their PROBLEM or the BENEFIT, you’ll oversell them and lose their attention. 
This is why your Attention section should briefly affirm their desire to get the result, and move right to your OFFER.  
SECTION #2: Offer
Tell them that your product or service is the best way for them to achieve the BENEFIT by a specific deadline, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION. Seal this claim with your guarantee and risk removal, which we discussed in Chapter II.  
I’ll add here that the term “best” is relative and depends on the PROBLEM we’re solving, the AUDIENCE we’re talking to, and the type of SOLUTION we’re promoting. That’s why I’ve created a list of seven BENEFIT types. These will clearly define how to tell our AUDIENCE that our product or service is the best in its category. 
Next, use a “Here's what you'll get when you [ACTION]...” statement to introduce your OFFER stack using the following bullet points (don’t worry about the order): 
[relevant emoji] Tell them how your product or service is relevant (personalized or customized) to someone like them. 
[relevant emoji] Tell them (or show them with social proof) how your product or service is superior to others in its category.
[relevant emoji] Tell them how your product or service is unique and one-of-a-kind amongst others in its category. 
[relevant emoji] Tell them how your product or service delivers the PROMISE without their EXTERNAL OBJECTION. 
[relevant emoji] Tell them how your product or service delivers the PROMISE despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
[relevant emoji] Remind them of what you’ll do to back up the PROMISE your OFFER makes (Risk Removal).
Finish this section by telling your reader who your OFFER is for. Restate your PROMISE to deliver a BENEFIT by a specific deadline, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION. For extra impact (this is optional), use a “that’s why…” or “I’m so confident of this that…” followed by a reminder of your risk removal.

Openers (Trip-Wire) 
Trip-Wire Opening Formulas
Having written and troubleshot literally thousands of sales pages since 2008, I’ve discovered four types of openings to be the most effective:
1.	The “Two Paths” Opening
2.	The Hypnotic Opening
3.	The Bold Promise Opening
4.	The Pain to Promise Opening
In this section, I’ll show you the psychology behind these openings, and give you an example of each below. 
Formula #1: The “Two Paths” Opening
The Two Paths opening tells a story of two people who start out in the same place and end up in dramatically different places by the end of the story. The most famous example of this is the “two young men” story that ran from 1975 to 2003 and sold $2 billion worth of Wall St. Journal subscriptions. Since then, hundreds of marketers and copywriters have repurposed this story to sell all kinds of stuff. In my experience, The Two Paths Story is most effective when you’re selling something that improves your prospect’s health, relationships, financial life, or career. 
Start your Two Paths Story by introducing the two characters at the time when their lives were similar. Make sure they either have the PROBLEM that your product or service solves, or are trying to achieve the BENEFIT. Both characters should have equal potential to succeed. 
Next, fast forward to a time when both characters have had enough time to achieve their goal. Start by telling your reader what the characters still have in common. Then, reveal an astonishing difference between the one who succeeded in solving the PROBLEM and/or achieving the BENEFIT, and the other who either failed, or ended up worse off. Don’t tell your reader what made the difference yet. 
Next, use a “What Was The Difference…” or “Here’s What Happened…” to transition out of the story. Ask your reader if they’ve ever wondered what makes the difference in people who succeed at solving the PROBLEM and/or achieving the BENEFIT, and those who fail. Follow this with a few sentences that tell your prospect what doesn’t make the difference. Ideally, you should base these on the MYTHS or ALTERNATIVES we discussed in Chapters IV and V. You can also use these “what it’s not…” statements to tell your reader that success is possible even without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and/or despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Finish your story by revealing the advantage, and make sure it’s something that your reader needs your OFFER in order to get. Use a “This is why…” or “And that’s why…” statement to tie the advantage you’ve just revealed to your prospect’s decision to say yes to your OFFER. Here’s an example using the classic Wall Street Journal letter.  
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Dear Reader:
On a beautiful late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, two young men graduated from the same college. They were very much alike, these two young men. Both had been better than average students, both were personable and both--as young college graduates are-were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.
Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion.
They were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had three children. And both, it turned out, had gone to work for the same Midwestern manufacturing company after graduation, and were still there.
But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small department of that company. The other was its president.
What Made The Difference?
Have you ever wondered, as I have, what makes this kind of difference in people's lives? It isn't always a native intelligence or talent or dedication. It isn't that one person wants success and the other doesn't.
The difference lies in what each person knows and how he or she makes use of that knowledge.
And that is why I am writing to you and to people like you about The Wall Street Journal. For that is the whole purpose of The Journal: To give its readers knowledge-knowledge that they can use in business.
***********************************END************************************
Here’s another example from a direct mail letter I wrote selling a skin care product. You’ll notice that I moved the “What Made the Difference…” section to the top, but the story is the same. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
What Made The Difference?
Have you ever wondered, as I have, why some men seem to struggle with acne all their life? Contrary to what you might have heard, it’s not their diet, their skin care routine, or even their genetics. 
The difference lies in whether they understand what causes acne in the first place, and how to manage it. For example, twenty-five years ago, two young men graduated from the same high school. They were very much alike. They were both smart, good looking, and both graduated with honors. They also both struggled with acne during all of their teen years. They never got to date much, and they were always scared to talk to girls or to take their shirts off while playing sports with their guy friends. 
Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion.
They were still very much alike. Both had gotten married. Both had three children. And both, it turned out, had active social lives.
But there was a difference. One of them was happily married to the woman of his dreams, in great health, with clear skin, and working his dream job at a great company. The other was divorced, struggling to pay his bills, and still suffered from frequent bouts of adult acne, depression, and social anxiety.
Here’s What Happened…
I was the second man in that story. The other was a friend of mine who recently told me how he finally got rid of adult acne, for good, AND overcame the damage done to his self-image while suffering from it. 
Since I met him at our reunion, I’ve enjoyed the clearest and healthiest skin I’ve ever had in my life. The social anxiety I once felt when talking to women is almost gone, and I just got engaged to my high-school crush, and I’ve never been happier in my life. 
If you’re suffering from adult acne, and ready to be free of it for good, here’s why this might be the most important letter you’ve ever read. 
***********************************END************************************
Notice that I did two things in this example. First, I debunked the MYTHS about diet, skin care routines, and the INTERNAL OBJECTION about genetics. Secondly, I created high-value curiosity with this statement:
“The difference lies in whether they understand what causes acne in the first place, and how to manage it.”
Notice how this statement is attached to an outcome my reader wants, but it doesn’t give the “difference” away. This is a breadcrumbing technique, which I talk about in my article below on suspense in copywriting. 
www.sethczerepak.com/suspense-in-copywriting 
I started the story this way because, unlike the time when the Wall Street Journal’s  “two young men” story was in its heyday, today’s consumers are much more distracted. They don’t have as much time or patience for stories. Unless, of course, you start by framing that story within the context of something they want. Other than that minor adjustment, this type of story is still damn effective for opening a sales letter.  
Formula #2: The Hypnotic Opening
A hypnotic opening is the simplest opening to explain. Just write a description of the sensory experience your prospect will have if they buy and use your product or service. Now if only they were that easy to write. This topic is so broad and complex, that I’m going to refer you to two sources on it. The first is my article on hypnotic copywriting below. 
www.sethczerepak.com/hypnotic-copywriting 
The second source is a book called “A Writer’s Coach,” by Jack Hart. Chapter Nine covers a technique the author calls “Color,” and it’s the secret to mastering the hypnotic opening. Go buy this book right now, and don’t whine because I’m asking you to buy another book on top of mine. I’m recommending this book because it’s the most useful book I’ve ever read on how to write well. Get it and read it as often as you can. You’ll see what I mean. 
Since there’s no real structure to a hypnotic opening, I’ll just share one for each of the five senses and follow them up with some remarks. I’ve included an invitation at the end of this chapter to a discounted customization call that will show you how to get help creating similar openings for your product or service. 
EXAMPLE #1: Let Them See it
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Just Picture This...
You step out of bed in the morning and walk just ten steps onto your pine-wood balcony to gaze at endless miles of mist-wrapped, blue mountains. Imagine cooking breakfast over a wood-fire stove, and sipping coffee on your back porch where bald eagles and red-shouldered hawks soar across a bright summer sky.
In the afternoon, you’ll tour the winding wooded nature path where beams of golden sunlight shine through crisp maple leaves. At sunset, relax on your wrap-around porch with a warm cup of tea and watch the star-studded vertical horizon of the milky way fade into view. This is a glimpse of the soul-soothing treasures that await you at your blue-ridge cabin getaway.
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #2: Let Them Hear it
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Listen closely…
You can almost hear the soft crash and hiss of waves, the cry of seagulls, and the summer breeze whistling through palm leaves. “Would you like another drink?” “Yes please,” you answer.
Your waitress slides a frost-caked bottle of Corona from a bucket of ice, cracks it open and sets it on your table with a fresh slice of lime. 
Isn’t it time to turn off the clamoring of ring tones, text chimes, email alerts, and office chatter to fall in love with the sounds of the ocean again? 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #3: Let Them Feel it
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
You can feel it…
Raw animal power surges through your veins, your muscles vibrating with pure energy. You just slammed your first all-natural, delicious Honey Badger Pre-Workout Formula, and you’re ready to wrap your hands around some cold-hard iron. 
Sick of feeling like a blown-out tire halfway through your workout? Remember when you could push your physical limits for hours, without waking up to throbbing pain in your shoulders and lower back the next day?
Now you can get that surging explosive beast-like energy back and stack on rippling slabs of sleeve-busting muscle by squeezing every drop of juice from your workout time. 
Grab a pack of smooth, delicious, all-natural, energy-packed Honey Badger Pre-and-Post-Workout Formulas, and get ready to feel your beast awaken again.
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #4: Let Them Smell it
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Breath it in…
Enjoy the sweet smell of citrus candles, and warm cinnamon, pine, jasmine, fig, or floral massage oil as you lie down for a deep tissue Swedish facial massage. 
Our scientifically designed scent profiles activate your smell receptors, sending messages to your body to regulate heart rate, breathing patterns, lower your blood pressure, and reduce anxiety.

***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #5: Let Them Taste it
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Just take a bite…
Sink your teeth into the hottest, crispiest, most delicious slice of deep dish, New York Style Pizza you’ve ever tasted. 
Taste the thick layers of chewy mozzarella over a bed of fresh, tangy homemade tomato sauce. 
All our pies are made with hand-tossed crust and baked to piping hot perfection in a wood-fire oven imported directly from Italy!

***********************************END************************************
Notice how I used an “if___, then ___” transition at the end of some of these examples. This is how I anchor by OFFER to the experience I’ve just created in my reader’s imagination. As you might have already guessed, these openings can also be used to create ads. They’re especially effective when the experience of using the product or service is also the BENEFIT. 
For example, if I’m selling a vacation, a dessert, or a romantic night at the theater, I’m literally selling an experience. I can use a hypnotic opening to describe my prospect at the vacation spot, eating the dessert, or feeling that rush of adrenaline when his wife breathes deeply, and grabs his hand during the toe curling climax of “Nessun Dorma” as they watch from their private balcony at the Sydney Opera House. 
But, if I'm selling a gym membership or a training course on how to grow your business, my prospect probably won’t enjoy using my product. In this case, my hypnotic opening needs to describe the end result of using my product. Or, I can use my hypnotic opening to create a contrast between the negative experience of the PROBLEM and the positive experience of the BENEFITS. 
Finally, I can use a hypnotic opening to describe only the negative experience of my prospect’s PROBLEM. Negative hypnotic openings motivate our prospect to say yes to our OFFER to escape the pain of their PROBLEM. You’ll find examples of negative hypnotic openings in my copywriting portfolio at the link below. Look for the examples on carpet beetles, dust mites, and the example that vividly describes the signs of a coming heart attack.

Formula #3: The Bold Promise Opening
This is a super powerful way to open a sales letter, ad, email, or direct mailer. The formula is simple, you PROMISE an outcome by a specific DEADLINE, and assure them that it will happen without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. You can also add some CONDITIONS to tell your prospect how easy, fast, powerful, etc (see my “Super Seven” in Chapter XI) it will be for your prospect to experience the PROMISE. Finally, use your RISK REMOVAL offer to tell them what you’re willing to do if they buy and use your product or service, and the PROMISE doesn’t happen by the DEADLINE. 
1.	PROMISE: you’ll lose 10% of your body fat.
2.	DEADLINE: in the next 90 days. 
3.	EXTERNAL OBJECTION: starving yourself, wrecking your metabolism, or lowering your energy level.
4.	INTERNAL OBJECTION: even if you’ve been overweight for years and tried multiple diets with no results.
5.	CONDITIONS: follow a 30 minute daily workout, and a simple done-for-you nutrition plan. 
6.	RISK REMOVAL: refund your money and pay you $100. 
You can start this opening with a “Dear [AUDIENCE]” statement, as in the example below. Next, use one of the following three frameworks to finish your opening: 
●	Option #1: Question w/Contrast
Ask a series of questions that focus on their desire to experience the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the INTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the EXTERNAL OBJECTION. 
These questions can start with "Do you want…" or “Are you ready…" or “What if you could…” or “How would you like…” or “How would your ___ change if…” or “Can you imagine…” and include the first four variables covered above. 
●	Option #2: Future Pacing
Use a “imagine” or “picture” or “How would your…” or “How would you feel if…” or “What would your…” or “What would you do/think if…”  statement to get your prospect to see themselves experiencing the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the INTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the EXTERNAL OBJECTION. This is called “future pacing,” a topic I cover in detail in my article below. 
www.sethczerepak.com/hypnotic-copywriting 
●	Option #3: If ___, Then ___
Use a series of “If___, then___” statements that affirm your prospect’s desire to experience the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the INTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the EXTERNAL OBJECTION. 
These statements can start with "If you want…" or “If you’re ready…" or “If you could…” or “If I could show you…” and include the first four variables covered above, finishing with either a statement like one of these:
●	“...you’re going to love this program.”
●	“...this is the program you’ve been searching for.”
●	“...starting this program will be the best decision of your life.”
…or a question like one of these:
●	“...would you be interested?”
●	“...what would your life look like?”
●	“...how soon would you want to get started?”
OPTIONAL: include a sentence summarizing the CONDITIONS for your prospect to experience the PROMISE summarized above.
Finish your Bold Promise Opening a “(If ___), here’s why…” followed by a summary of your RISK REMOVAL to transition to the next section of your sales letter. 
EXAMPLE #1: Question w/Contrast
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
What if you could lose 10% of your body fat in the next 90 days, without starving yourself, wrecking your metabolism, or lowering your energy level? 
What if you could do this, even if you’ve been overweight for years and tried multiple diets with no results?
Would you be interested? 
If so, I want to show you a 30 minute daily workout, and a simple done-for-you nutrition plan that will do exactly that. 
In fact, here’s why I’ll refund your money and pay you $100 if you use this program and it doesn’t do what I just promised. 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #2: Future Pacing
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Imagine yourself losing 10% of your body fat in the next 90 days, without starving yourself, wrecking your metabolism, or lowering your energy level. 
What if I told you this could happen even if you’ve been overweight for years and tried multiple diets with no results?
Imagine if you could do this by following a 30 minute daily workout, and a simple done-for-you nutrition plan that will do exactly that. 
If you’re getting excited just hearing this, here’s why I’ll refund your money and pay you $100 if you use this program and it doesn’t do what I just promised. 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #3: If ___, Then ___
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
If I showed you a way to lose 10% of your body fat in the next 90 days, without starving yourself, wrecking your metabolism, or lowering your energy level, would you be interested? 
What if I told you this could happen even if you’ve been overweight for years and tried multiple diets with no results?
If you’re getting excited just hearing this, I want to show you a 30 minute daily workout, and a simple done-for-you nutrition plan that will do exactly that. 
Here’s why I’ll refund your money and pay you $100 if you use this program and it doesn’t do what I just promised. 
***********************************END************************************
Notice how short and simple these openings are, but how they also do six things:
1.	They affirm your prospect’s desire to experience the PROMISE.
2.	They answer your prospect’s question about how long it will take (DEADLINE).
3.	They answer your prospect’s EXTERNAL OBJECTION.
4.	They answer your prospect’s INTERNAL OBJECTION.  
5.	They answer your prospect’s question about what they’ll have to do (CONDITIONS).
6.	They tell your prospect how you’ll back up the PROMISE you’ve made to them (RISK REMOVAL).
The rest of your sales letter copy will simply restate, reinforce, and reassure your prospect of these six things. 
Formula #4: The Pain to Promise Opening
This opening is nearly identical to the Bold Promise Opening, with one extra detail. You’ll start by asking them three questions or making three statements that confirm their experience with the SYMPTOMS of the PROBLEM. 
These questions can start with "Have you decided…" or “Are you ready…" or “What is ___, doing to your…” or “Can you really afford to keep…” and finish with a description of one of the SYMPTOMS of your prospect’s PROBLEM. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Dear Friend,
Have you noticed your energy level declining? 
Are you having trouble focusing at work, or keeping up with your kids? 
Do you feel like your sex drive is rapidly declining, and are you losing self-confidence when you see yourself in pictures, or in the bathroom mirror? 
What if, instead, you could shed 10% of body fat in the next 90 days, without starving yourself, wrecking your metabolism, or lowering your energy level? 
What if you could do this, even if you’ve been overweight for years and tried multiple diets with no results?
Would you be interested? 
If so, I want to show you a 30 minute daily workout, and a simple done-for-you nutrition plan that will do exactly that. 
In fact, here’s why I’ll refund your money and pay you $100 if you use this program and it doesn’t do what I just promised. 
***********************************END************************************
Notice how this is nearly identical to your Bold Promise Opening. All I’ve done is added three pain-focused questions to the beginning. You now have everything you need to write a compelling opening for the sales page of your Trip-Wire Funnel. I’ve included an invitation at the end of this chapter to a discounted customization call that will show you how to get help creating your sales page openings. The next micro-commitment in your Trip-Wire Funnel will be to sell your prospect on the relevance, superiority, and uniqueness of your product or service. This is called Positioning, and it’s the most powerful, most misunderstood, and most widely neglected idea in marketing.

6.	Enjoyable
7.	Stylish


 
Positioning (Working) 
Positioning Prompts:
Now write the positioning copy. This section MUST be consistent with what’s in the copy we’ve already created for this funnel. Please create the elements one at a time. Please use the content in the article below as a guide in creating my Offer Positioning Message. 
www.sethczerepak.com/positioning-in-copywriting
My Offer Positioning message will include these elements:
1.	X Factor
2.	Superiority
3.	Uniqueness
4.	Relevance 
5.	Qualification
The order of these elements is somewhat flexible, but our Offer Positioning message should include all of them. If we’re in an information saturated market, put the “Superiority” element before the X Factor, followed by the “X Factor,” and then the others. 
If my goal is to filter out clients we don’t want to work with, put the “Qualification” element before the “X Factor,” followed by the “X Factor,” and then the others. 
Create each element of my Offer Positioning message one at a time, and wait for my approval on one before creating the next. 
Element #1: X Factor
This element MUST “X Factor” flaw described in our Solution Pitch above. Remember that our Solution Pitch warned our prospect of a flaw in the general SOLUTION (product or service type) that we’re offering. Now, it’s time to show them how our brand of the SOLUTION either fixes or compensates for this flaw. 
Start your X Factor Pitch by “[PRODUCT] is a [SOLUTION] that/with…” followed by a detailed description of either the BENEFITS of your OFFER (if you’re using a webinar or VSL Funnel) or a description of its key features (if you’re using a Trip-Wire Funnel). 
Next, tell your prospect how your product or service was made. Include specific details about the years or decades that went into developing it. Tell them how much money and time was spent on research, experimentation, expert guidance, input from the AUDIENCE'S peers, and anything else that’s valuable and relevant. 
Next, tell them how you apply all the above things to solve the PROBLEM and/or deliver the PROMISE by the DEADLINE. 
Next, use a “This makes…” or “This is why…” statement to tell your prospect that this is the best (see my “Super Seven” in Chapter XI) SOLUTION for solving the PROBLEM without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Finish with a bold claim that your product or service is the only SOLUTION of its kind that offers the above advantages. Tie this off with your GUARANTEE and RISK REMOVAL or by making an open challenge to your competitors, as I did in this example.

***********************************END************************************
Your X Factor pitch might end up being shorter, or longer depending on how saturated  your market is with other products or services like yours. 
Element #2: Relevance
Relevance is how you show your AUDIENCE that your OFFER is ideal for someone like them. You use it to prove the following two points:
●	That you’re likable and memorable (Charisma)
●	That you about your their success (Character)
Relevance is also how you answer this question: 
“Is this the best solution for someone like me?”
For B2B prospects, the question will be:
“Is this the best solution for a company like ours?”
The key phrases are “someone like me” and “a company like ours.” This is important because, while some prospects will doubt whether your product or service works, others will doubt whether your product or service will work for them. Relevance answers the second doubt by demonstrating two things: 
1.	Demographic Relevance.
2.	Psychographic Relevance.
Demographic relevance focuses on demographic details that your customers have in common with your prospect. Psychographic relevance addresses your prospect’s pain points, desires, doubts, and past disappointments with other products. Together, these two types of relevance dissolve your prospect’s fears about their situation being too complex or unique for your OFFER to work for them. 
Start your Relevance Pitch with a subheader (or callout) that ties the demographic details of your AUDIENCE directly to your product or service and what it does. For example, you might say “Here’s why [PRODUCT] is best (see my Super Seven in Chapter XI) for [AUDIENCE] who want [PROMISE]...” or “Why[AUDIENCE] prefer [PRODUCT] for [PROMISE].”
Follow this up with a short paragraph that empathizes with how the SYMPTOMS of your prospect’s PROBLEM uniquely impact people in their demographic. If you can use a “This is why…” statement to say that this is why other products or services have not worked for them, all the better.  
Next, use a statement that starts with “That’s why…” or “Thankfully…” followed by a short description of how your product or service was specifically made for your prospect’s demographic. Finish this paragraph with a “This means…” statement about how your OFFER delivers the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION.
Next, use a statement that starts with “That’s what makes [PRODUCT]...” or “This is why [PRODUCT]…” and reaffirms the exact statement made in your first sentence. For example, you might say “That’s what makes [PRODUCT] is best (see my Super Seven in Chapter XI) for [AUDIENCE] who want [PROMISE]...” or “This is the first reason [AUDIENCE] prefer [PRODUCT] for [PROMISE].”
You’ve now demonstrated the Demographic Relevance of your product or service. 
Next, you’ll demonstrate Psychographic Relevance with another subheader (or callout). This one will tell our AUDIENCE how our product or service aligns with either their shopping preferences or the ideological values. For example, this headline appeals to shopping preferences:
Your Convenience is Our Top Priority
If convenience is the top priority for my AUDIENCE, this headline ^ is perfect. If they prefer fast results or delivery, I might say something like this instead:
Here’s How We Cater to Your Need for Speed
If they favor safety and comfort, I might say something like this: 
Why We’re The Safest Way to Lose Fat
I’ll show you how to find the shopping preferences of your AUDIENCE in Chapter XI when I introduce my Super Seven. 
Here’s an example of a headline that appeals to their ideological values: 
The #1 Earth-Friendly Skin Care Brand
Here’s another example: 
The #1 Choice Coffee for The American Patriot
Follow this headline with the exact same formula that we used to debunk ALTERNATIVE solutions. Only this time, use the formula to emphasize how your brand beats every competitor on the claim you just made in your subheader. 
OPTIONAL: Finish with a bold claim that your product or service is the only SOLUTION of its kind that offers the above advantages. Tie this off with your GUARANTEE and RISK REMOVAL or by making an open challenge to your competitors, as I did in this example.  
The example below assumes that your AUDIENCE is a physically active man in his 50s suffering from severe foot pain, caused by gout. He mistrusts prescription medications and other conventional medical interventions. He is especially averse to the idea of getting surgery. The following example shows how you’d position your OFFER as the most Relevant. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
3 Reasons We’re The Most Popular Natural Gout Treatment Provider For Men In Their 50s
Reason #1: It’s YOUR Treatment
Something changes when a man turns 50.
Diets, workouts, and pain treatments don’t work as they did in your 30s.  That’s why our all-natural gout treatment was custom-made for active men between ages 50 and 65. This means FASTER, SAFER, and LONG LASTING relief from the crippling pain of sudden gout flare ups.  
You’re getting a treatment custom created with YOU and your body in mind. That’s what makes us the most popular provider of all-natural gout treatments in America. 
Reason #2: All Natural AND Doctor Recommended
There are only a handful of all-natural gout treatments on the market. 
They’ll all tell you that their product is made with all-natural ingredients. What they won’t tell you is whether those ingredients are also cut with trace amounts of chemicals they are not required to list on their labels. 
What’s the point in an “all-natural” product that smuggles in a cocktail of potentially carcinogenic chemicals? 
Some claim that their product is “doctor recommended.” What they won’t tell you is whether those doctors were paid a commission to promote the product to their patients. 
Why trust a recommendation from someone who makes money selling the product?
***********************************END************************************
Element #3: Superiority
Superiority is how you show your AUDIENCE that your product or service delivers their desired outcome better than any competitor. You use it to prove the following two points:
1.	That you’re easy to do business with (Convenience)
2.	That you’re capable of delivering results (Competence) 
Superiority is how you answer this question:
“How do I know this product/service works?”
Proving superiority comes down to these four factors, which I’ve listed in order of importance:
1.	Results: successes your customers have had using your product or service.
2.	Reviews: what other customers have said about your product or service.
3.	Endorsements: what industry experts have said about your product or service.
4.	Experience: years you’ve been in business and/or number of customers you’ve served.
If your message nails all four of these points, you’ve effectively answered your prospect’s question about whether your product works.
Start your Superiority Pitch with a subheader (or callout if you’re using a webinar or VSL) that ties the demographic details of your AUDIENCE directly to their desire to solve the PROBLEM and experience the PROMISE without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION. For example, you might say “Are you tired of…” or “If you’re tired of…” followed by a complaint about their experience with other products and services.” Or, you might say “Are you ready to finally…” or “If you’re ready to…” followed by a statement about achieving the desired outcome. 
Next, you’ll use the timeless and super-effective “Feel, Felt Found” formula to empathize with your AUDIENCE and clearly state your PROMISE, including the DEADLINE, specific BENEFITS, and a reminder that it will happen without their EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION.  
OPTIONAL: If your product or service is aligned with the ideological values of your AUDIENCE, and if this is one of their bigger selling points, include a little more psychographic relevance here, as I’ve done in the example below with my short rant about the IRS. 
Next, include a wall of your customer testimonials to back up the claim you’ve just made. Choose testimonials where your customers talk specifically about results that align with your PROMISE. Use bold type or red markers (circles or underlines) to draw attention to these parts of your testimonials. 
After your testimonials, use a second subheader (or callout) that either invites your prospect to join your clients (use a word that matches your reader. For example, you might say “Join These Happy Clients…” or “Now it’s Your Turn to [PROMISE].”
Follow this with a “These are just a few of...” statement that ties your testimonials to your total number of customers, and to your PROMISE. For extra effect, remind your prospect of the DEADLINE, the  EXTERNAL and INTERNAL OBJECTIONS, and the COMMITMENT required to experience the PROMISE. 
Next, use the same formula that we used to debunk ALTERNATIVE solutions to emphasize how your brand beats every competitor on the claims you’ve just proven with your testimonials. 
Next, remind prospects how your product or service was made. Include specific details about the years or decades that went into developing it. Tell them how much money and time was spent on research, experimentation, expert guidance, input from the AUDIENCE'S peers, and anything else that’s valuable and relevant. 
OPTIONAL: Tell your prospect the total or average (or both) amount of money your customers have paid you, the time they’ve invested into working with you or using your product or service, and of the results they’ve gotten (I.E., “I’ve helped my clients lose an average of 32 lbs their first month…” or “We’ve saved our clients a total of $38 billion in taxes…” or “Our average customer drinks 3 of our healthy and delicious smoothies every day.”).
If your product or service is endorsed by anyone who your AUDIENCE recognizes as an expert, or a hero, include them here. These can also be experts who have endorsed the idea your product or service is based on, or a feature/ingredient of your product. I call the latter a surrogate endorsement. The most important thing is that your AUDIENCE recognizes and trusts or respects the person giving the endorsement. Otherwise, the endorsement means nothing…no matter who the person is. 
Finish with a “Why [NEGATIVE], when you can [POSITIVE]...” question that contrasts the experience of using ALTERNATIVES and/or competitors with the experience of using and benefitting from your OFFER. 
This example assumes that our prospect is a business owner whose tax records and payroll are a mess because he simply hates dealing with such things. He has Libertarian-leaning political beliefs and resents the IRS’s constant demands on his time and money. He believes that a good CPA should share his values and help him keep more of what he earns. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Are You Tired Of Being “Legally Robbed” By The IRS?
Do you feel like most CPAs only want to nag and needle you about complying with the IRS and playing by the “rules?” 
Do you feel like your tax savings are maxed out and that you just have to pay what the IRS demands of you?
That’s how a lot of my clients felt before finding me. But what they’ve found is that hiring me is the fastest and least time-consuming way to gain a powerful ally in their battle to keep more of their money. 
Like you, I’m an old-school unapologetic American entrepreneur. I believe small businesses are the true heart of the American economy. That’s why I hate seeing you forced to hand boatloads of your hard-earned money to an irresponsible and incompetent government. 
My goal is to help you:
●	Keep as much of YOUR money as possible.
●	Keep the IRS off your back so you can serve your customers.
Best of all, I can have you saving 30% or more on your taxes by the next quarter, without long meetings, even if your tax records are a mess and you don’t know where to find everything. Here’s what my clients are saying:
— SECTION HERE WITH CLIENT TESTIMONIALS —
Join My Alliance Of Happy Customers
These are just a few of HUNDREDS of entrepreneurs who have put MORE money in their pockets, simply by keeping me on their payroll.
Other CPAs might promise you the same results, but what they WON’T tell you is whether their clients are actually getting them!
I’ve worked with over 5,000 entrepreneurs across 102 industries. I’ve saved my clients a total of more than a BILLION dollars over my 30-year career. 
So why trust your financial future to someone without a PROVEN track record, when you can hire a fellow liberty-loving citizen who knows how to keep the IRS off your back?

Notice how I’ve demonstrated Superiority and reinforced Psychographic Relevance in the above example. I used Dog Whistle Language (see the forward to this book) by saying “‘Legally Robbed’ by the IRS,” and “…old-school unapologetic American entrepreneur.” I said I believed that small businesses are the heart of the American economy, and I called the government irresponsible and incompetent.
These are appeals to psychographic relevance. They mean nothing to people outside my target audience, and might even seem offensive or over-the-top. But for the right AUDIENCE, they’re loaded with meaning and value. The only point I’m missing is expert endorsements, since the client I wrote this mailer for didn’t have any and wasn’t willing to use a surrogate endorsement. 
Element #4: Uniqueness
Uniqueness is how you show your prospect that they can’t get the “same thing” from anyone else. This is the most important element of positioning. It’s also the most widely neglected and easily misunderstood. It starts with finding your Unique Selling Proposition (aka, “USP”). Your USP is the one thing that makes your brand, product, or service uniquely superior to your competitor. The worst (and sadly the most common) attempts to define a USP sound like this:
●	“We stand by our product.”
●	“We pride ourselves on quality and service.”
●	“We guarantee your satisfaction.”
●	“We really care about our customers.”
These are a five star snoozefest, and not even close to being Unique Selling Propositions. They’re vague cliches that circle directly back to the question they’re supposed to answer:
“Can I get the same thing somewhere else?”
You’re convinced that your product or service really is better than competitors. Your existing customers probably are too. But your prospects haven’t used your product or service yet. They have no first-hand experience as to whether you’re telling the truth or what you even mean by vague statements about “quality,” “service,” or how much you “really care” about your customers.
Your USP shouldn’t require your prospect to know something that only you and your existing customers can know. It shouldn’t even try to convince them that you’re better. It should explain how you’re different in a way that adds value for them. Here are three rules for defining your USP:
1.	Make it Specific: Don’t use abstract words or phrases that require extra explanations or examples. This includes words like “quality,” “satisfaction,” “excellence,” and “services.” Your competitor can easily say the same things. Use concrete words and statements to make claims that can be objectively verified by examples, customer reviews, or scientific data.
2.	Make it Beneficial: Promise a specific benefit to your prospect and tie it to the thing that makes your product or service unique. This promise should be concrete enough to paint a “before and after” picture in the mind of your prospect. If your prospect can see a “mind movie” of themselves living out this promised benefit, you’re on the right track.
3.	Make it Unique: Your USP should allow you to claim something that your competitors can’t claim without legal consequences. Some examples include patented formulas or other legally protected features of your product or your service. This is where most companies fail to define a solid USP. They make claims about why they’re better, but not how they’re unique.
Start your USP Pitch with a subheader (or callout) that starts with “Here’s Why No Other [SOLUTION]…” or “Here’s a Promise (Offer, Guarantee, Commitment, etc) No Other [SOLUTION]…” followed by clear and bold definition of your “hill to die on.” 
Next, clearly and state the mechanism (i.e., framework, method, ingredient, process, etc) that makes your product or service truly unique. Remember that if your competitor can honestly claim the same thing without legal consequences, it’s not a USP. For extra effect, include the time, money, energy, experimentation, and other resources that were invested into creating and perfecting your USP. 
Next, tie your unique mechanism to the PROMISE you’ve made to your prospect. You can do this by saying “This is why we’re the only [SOLUTION] that…” or “This is why we can promise…” or “This is how we…” or “This means you get…” followed by a summary of the PROMISE, the DEADLINE, and how it can happen for your prospect without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and/or despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Finish with a bold claim that your product or service is the only SOLUTION that offers this USP, and how you protect competitors from using it. Tie this off with your GUARANTEE and RISK REMOVAL or by making an open challenge for your competitors to outdo or to match your PROMISE.  
This example picks up where the superiority example left off. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Here’s A Promise No Other CPA Can Make You
During my 30 years in business, I’ve discovered and tested 77 checkpoints EVERY business tax return should undergo before being submitted to the IRS. 
Any one of these checkpoints could uncover something that saves you from being robbed at tax time or subjected to an intrusive, time-sucking tax audit. 
I keep a hard copy of this checklist in a safe in my office, and another xeroxed copy in a safety deposit box. I’ve never shown it to anyone. That’s why I’m 100% confident that no other CPA can offer you what I can. 
***********************************END************************************
Notice the first paragraph of this example makes a specific claim about what my USP is. The second paragraph makes a specific PROMISE to my prospect and ties it directly to the USP. The final paragraph explains why my service is unique in a way that my competitors can’t duplicate. If you’ve nailed the first two points of positioning (Relevance and Superiority), this simple USP formula will clearly show your AUDIENCE that they can’t get the “same thing” anywhere else. 
Element #5: Qualification
Qualification raises the perception of your product or service to the ceiling. The formula is simple, and based on reverse psychology. In sales, this is called a “Take Away.” I dislike that term because, in my opinion, Qualification should be exactly that. It should put up a big, bold stop sign telling your prospect who you want to do business with. It’s a mistake to assume that you should sell to anyone willing to buy from you. Some customers are more trouble than they’re worth, and others will literally be a drain on your profits. That’s the first practical reason for including a Qualification Pitch. 
The second reason is that it truly does elevate the perceived value of your product or service. Most people want something more the second they realize they can’t have it. 
Start your Qualification Pitch with a direct command for your prospect to stop and pay attention. Tie this to a statement about them saying yes to your OFFER. For example, your stop command might look like this:
●	Wait! Before You Order
●	STOP! Before You Sign Up
●	WARNING: Read This Before You Apply
Follow this with a statement that assumes your prospect is ready to buy. For example, you might say:
●	There’s a reason you’re about to [ACTION]
●	I know you’re excited about [PROMISE]
●	We know you’re ready to [ACTION] and [PROMISE]
OPTIONAL: Remind them of the details of your PROMISE, your GUARANTEE, or your USP. 
Then, make either a REDEEMABLE ADMISSION, OR a “This isn’t for everyone…” statement, followed by a description of the type of customers or clients your OFFER is for. A REDEEMABLE ADMISSION is something that sounds damaging to your brand at first, but has a silver lining for the right prospect. 
For example, one of my clients has an 84 day extreme fat loss program that I’ve recently (while writing this actually) used to go from 260 lbs and 35% body fat, down to 195 lbs and 8% body fat. 
We created a Qualification Pitch that literally says “Not for Beginners!” This is not a gimmick, as the program is extremely intense, and not for newbies or snowflakes. He also calls it “the best program you’ll ever use…or quit.” This is a REDEEMABLE ADMISSION. We’re stating something that sounds negative at first, but makes it more appealing for someone who is tired of gimmicks, and willing to invest their time, money, and effort to get the result.   
(BTW, if you’re interested in a similar result and willing to do the work and to invest in yourself, message me on Social Media, and I’ll connect you with the program’s creator.)
Next, use a “This is for…” or “We’re looking for…” or “I created this [SOLUTION] for..” or “This is only for…” followed by a detailed description of how the Redeemable Admission will be an advantage for the right person. 
Next, use Dan S Kennedy’s famous “winners and losers'' formula to make a contrast between who your OFFER is for, and who it isn’t. This formula starts with a sentence that contrasts the experience of the “winners” with the experience of the “losers.” Next, it confirms that it’s better to be a winner, and follows with three specific examples of the difference between the two. Here are some examples of this controversial, but super-effective formula at work.
EXAMPLE #1: Money/Business 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
In the game of business, a few people win big, while the rest struggle for every dollar they make. 
I think we can both agree that it’s better to win. 
It’s better to get rich than to worry about money. It’s better to get paid what you’re worth than haggle with ungrateful clients over your prices. It’s better to enjoy your work, and your life, without constantly putting out fires. 
***********************************END************************************
 EXAMPLE #2: Health/Appearance
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
When it comes to being in shape, some men stay ripped and sexy into their late 50s and 60s. Others have to feel self-conscious taking off their shirts in public. 
I think every man secretly knows that it’s better to look fit and sexy. 
It’s better to have a rippling six pack, than a spare tire. It’s better to be the leanest guy at the gym than to have a dad bod. It’s better to enjoy playing with your grandkids than to run out of breath just climbing a flight of stairs.  
***********************************END************************************
 EXAMPLE #2: Dating/Relationships 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
When it comes to dating and marriage, most men have to settle. Only a few men get the woman they really want. 
I think we’ll both agree that it’s better to get what you want. 
It’s better to have healthy conversations than to feel like you’re dating a pouty teenager. It’s better to look forward to seeing her in a bikini than to secretly wish she’d take better care of herself. It’s better to feel like you’ve found a partner and a cheerleader than to have to compete for her respect.
***********************************END************************************
You can also use shorter, simpler statements like these: 
●	For every entrepreneur who gets rich, there are thousands who can only dream about it and struggle to achieve it.
●	For every man who gets lean and ripped, there are hundreds who kill themselves in the gym to look a bit above average. 
●	For every man who marries the woman of his dreams, there are thousands who have to settle.
Follow this up with a question or statement like “What’s the difference…” or “Here’s the difference…” then draw a contrast between the results your ideal prospect is likely to get with the result an unqualified prospect is likely to get. 
Finish your Qualification Pitch with an “If___, then here’s ___” statement that speaks only to qualified prospects, and that restates your PROMISE, and/or introduces the OFFER you’re about to make. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
STOP: Before You Get Started…
There’s a reason you’re about to invest 5 times as much into his training as you would into most other systems.
It’s because this one works.
I know this because I’ve used it in thousands of other businesses. I’ve seen ordinary businesses go from being money pits, to being well-oiled, passive income machines.
But I’ll be honest, my system isn’t for everyone. It’s for people who are entrepreneurs at heart, and just need to build a business which is worthy of the vision picture in their mind.
But I’m 100% convinced that you’re either born as an entrepreneur or you’re not. For every wildly successful entrepreneur, there are about 100 who will never earn any more money than they’re already making.
What’s the difference?
It’s simple. Ordinary people want to get to own a business so they won’t have to work. True entrepreneurs love to work. They simply want to do the work they love most. They want a business which gives them the freedom to use their talents to make life better and to make a lasting impact on the world.
If your heart is leaping in your chest at the thought of this, you’re ready to get started. And with this system, you’ll never have to waste your time trying to get there by trial and error.

Retargetting 
 
Ad/Post (Retargetting) 
RETARGETTING Ad Prompt:
Act as a master direct response copywriter and write a retargeting ad for promoting the OFFER above to the AUDIENCE above. Make the ad follow this formula:
1.	Reminder: restate the pain or desire of your AUDIENCE.
2.	Offer: restate your No-Brainer Offer and what it does. 
3.	Action: call the AUDIENCE to a specific and urgent action.
IMPORTANT:
●	DO NOT label the sections within the finished ad!
●	This ad should be a FINISHED Product–ready to publish, with emojis and with NO placeholders of labels or commentary. 
●	Limit your sentence length to 35 to 45 characters, and line breaks with DOUBLE spaces between each sentence.  
Here’s a breakdown how to write each of these sections of your ad:
SECTION #1: Reminder
[red, orange, or yellow emoji] Start this section with a demographic callout to your AUDIENCE, and then jump right into the part instructed below.
EXAMPLE #1a: Question w/Contrast (Positive First)
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Hey, don’t you want to squat and deadlift more weight? 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #1: Question w/Contrast (Negative First)
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Still want to get rid of foot pain? 
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #2: Future Pacing
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
They’re waiting…the woman of your dreams and your three beautiful children.  
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #3: If [PROMISE], then [RESPONSE]
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Why keep struggling to find leads for your business? 
***********************************END************************************
Notice how short and bold these openings are. This is because Stage #4 Prospects are mostly sold on your OFFER. They’re either procrastinating, or unsure whether they can trust you to deliver. This is why your Reminder section should briefly affirm their desire to get the result, so you can hit these trust points.  
SECTION #2: Offer
This section will be similar to your Trip-Wire ad, with two differences. 
Firstly, it will be shorter, including only a summary of the OFFER and PROMISE, a bit of proof or a story that reinforces your OFFER, and a restatement of your guarantee. 
Secondly, it will reinforce the type of trust that’s most likely to make them buy. I’ll show you how to find out which type of trust to reinforce in Chapter XI when we talk about split testing. 
Let’s look at two examples, one for each of the two most important types of trust. 
EXAMPLE #1: Reinforce Competence
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
This four week mobility program has helped 1,367 ammeter runners recover their strength and mobility. Here are some of their success stories: 
[SHORT CLIPS FROM TESTIMONIALS HERE] 
Are you ready to create your own success story?
Remember, I’ll refund your money AND buy your next pair of shoes if you’re not feeling better after four weeks of using this program. That’s the strongest guarantee in the industry!
***********************************END************************************
EXAMPLE #2: Reinforce Character
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
This four week mobility program has helped 1,367 ammeter runners recover their strength and mobility. More than that, it gave them back their confidence and their faith in themselves. 
It did the same for me, and I know it will for you. 
I created this program after years of being crippled by foot pain. Like you, I know what it's like to wonder whether something is going to work or not. 
That's why I'm offering to refund your money AND buy your next pair of shoes if you’re not free from foot problems after using this program. 
***********************************END************************************
SECTION #3: Action
Finish your ad by answering your prospect’s “what happens next” objection. Do this using bullet points that assure them of three things:
●	What they’re getting
●	How it will be delivered. 
●	The steps to getting the result. 
Write a strong call to action that tells them EXACTLY what to do, reminds them of why to do it, and adds some urgency as to Why they need to do it right now. Use the words "right now," "hurry" or other phrases to emphasize this urgency.
Finish with a "PS:" statement telling them that they missed out on the previous bonus offer, but that you’re making them another.

Reopening (Working) 
Reopening Prompts:
Now use the variables and subvariables to write an opening for our retargeting sales page. This is the opening MUST consistent with the retargeting ad/post we just created.
In my experience, the most effective way to open a retargeting sales page is with what I call a “Here’s Why” Story. I first learned this formula from my mentor Dan S Kennedy, and have seen it work remarkably in hundreds of marketing campaigns. Sure, there are other ways to open a retargeting page, but if you master the Here’s Why Story, you won’t need them. The Here’s Why Story tells your AUDIENCE the reason for any one of the following things:
1.	Offer Guarantee
2.	Offer Price
3.	Offer Urgency
Create one version of our opening for each of the formulas below. Create these versions one at a time and wait for my approval on one before writing the next one.
Formula #1: Reason for Guarantee
Start this story with a headline like this:
●	Here’s Why I’ll [RISK REMOVAL] if You Don’t [PROMISE]
●	Why Am I Offering [RISK REMOVAL] if You Don’t [PROMISE]?
Next, use an “If ___, you’re probably…” or “By now, you’re probably…” followed by a statement about them being eager to take action OR experience the PROMISE. 
Then, use a “But you might also be thinking (worrying, etc)…” followed by a reference to their EXTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Next, tell them you understand, and like a “Like you, I…” statement to confirm that you’ve had similar doubts and/or disappointments with other products or services. Follow this with a detailed story about a bad experience you had with a product or service. 
Start by telling them how excited you were when you bought it. Tell them about your anticipation. Tell them about how you day dreamed about owing, using, or benefiting from it. Make these descriptions relevant to the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional benefits of your PROMISE. 
Next, tell them about the stomach turning moment when you realized that the product or service wasn’t what you expected. Talk about what happened, and your physiological response to it. 
Next, tell them that you’ve had a handful of equally disappointing experiences with various types of products or services. Follow this with a “I’ve shared several reasons…” followed by a recap of your PROMISE. 
Next, tell them that if, after purchasing your OFFER and fulfilling the requirements for your guarantee, they feel like you did after that disappointing experience from your story, that you’ll honor your RISK REMOVAL offer. 
Finish with a statement like “If ___, here’s…” to transition to your Call to Action. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Here’s Why I’ll Pay You to Hire Someone Else if I Can’t Help You
If you’re still reading, you’re probably eager to get on a call and discuss your next marketing project. 
But you might also be thinking about someone who you hired in the past, someone who didn’t take the time to understand your needs or to deliver what you’d asked for.
I understand. Like you, I’ve had my share of disappointments. I’ve bought many things which didn’t live up to the promises in the ad.
When I was 14, I remember buying a model airplane set from the back of a magazine. The airplane looked great in the picture and the ad made it sound like a dream come true.
For weeks, I eagerly waited for my airplane kit to arrive in the mail. I imagined the finished plane sitting on the desk in my room, where everyone would come in and marvel over what I’d created.
I’ll never forget feeling my heart sink when I ripped open the box and unpacked a few cheap sheets of plastic and painted cardboard, along with a flimsy instruction manual.
Since then, I’ve had a handful of equally disappointing experiences, from cars, to computers, to hotel stays, to expensive vacations, to “professional” service providers who only seemed to care about taking my money.
I’ve shared several reasons why I’m confident that you’ll feel good about hiring me as your new copywriter.
But if at ANY time after hiring me, you feel that I’ve sold you a cheap, plastic and cardboard airplane, I’ll gladly pay you to hire someone else in my place.
If this is fair, here’s what you’ll want to do next...
***********************************END************************************
Formula #2: Reason for Price
Start this story with a headline like this:
●	If This is So Good, Why The Low Price?
●	Why Is This Only [OFFER PRICE]?
Next, use an “If ___, you’re probably…” or “By now, you’re probably…” followed by a statement about them being eager to take action OR experience the PROMISE. Then, use a “But you might also be wondering…” followed by a reference to their skepticism about the price. 
Next, tell them you understand how they feel, and like a “Like you, a lot of our customers felt the same way…” statement to confirm that many of your customers had the same skepticism when they first bought from you OR had bad experiences with “too good to be true” offers.
Next, use a “After working with us, our customers found that…” or “After working with us, our customers found that…” followed by references to how your customers have experienced the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Next, tell them you’re offering such a low price because you’re 100% confident that, after using your introductory OFFER, they’ll be so happy (impressed, excited, etc.) about the outcome, that they’ll want to either:
1.	Buy your larger ticket product or service. 
2.	Buy from you again and refer other customers. 
Next, remind them that if, after purchasing your OFFER and fulfilling the requirements for your guarantee, they feel like your price really was too good to be true, that you’ll honor your RISK REMOVAL offer. 
Finish with a statement like “If ___, here’s…” to transition to your Call to Action. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
If This is So Good, Why The Low Price? 
If you’re still reading, you’re probably eager to get on a call and discuss scaling your business with me. But you might also be worried that my introductory price of $499 is just too good to be true.
I understand how you feel. Hundreds of my clients felt the same way when they first came to me. Many of them had horrible experiences with other marketing strategists who promised them the world, but delivered nothing. 
After working with me, these skeptical clients found that my unique strategy and personalized approach was the smartest way to scale from six to seven figures in 18 months or less, without burning up their time and energy testing multiple offers, campaigns, and other strategies. 
Many of these clients had been stuck at the same income plateau for years before working with me. Some had lost faith in themselves and were ready to give up on their business altogether. 
I’m offering this introductory price of $499 because I’m 100% confident that, after working with me, you’ll be eager to work together at our regular price points because you’ll be making far more money than you’ve spent.  
And remember, if ANY time after hiring me, you feel that my price really was too good to be true, I’ll gladly pay you to hire someone else in my place.
If this sounds fair, here’s how you’ll get started...
***********************************END************************************
Formula #3: Reason for Urgency
Start this story with a headline like this:
●	Why Can’t I Get This After [OFFER DEADLINE]?
●	Here’s Why I’m Only Offering [OFFER SUPPLY]
●	Why Is This Only Available Until [OFFER DEADLINE]?
Next, use an “If ___, you’re probably…” or “By now, you’re probably…” followed by a statement about them being eager to take action OR experience the PROMISE. Then, use a “But you might also be wondering…” followed by a reference to their hesitation to start now. 
Next, tell them you understand, and like a “Like you, I…” statement to confirm that you (or your existing clients) have had similar doubts and/or disappointments about buying limited time or limited supply offers. 
Next, tell them the reason your OFFER is expiring by the DEADLINE or why you’re only offering a limited supply or your product or service. Here are some reasons I’ve seen work:
1.	Service Quality: you have a limited number of experts to fulfill the service because you want the best for your clients, so you only hire the best. 
2.	Exclusive Advantage: you want to give your clients an exclusive advantage by limiting how many people have access to your product or service.  
3.	Collector’s Appeal: you want your product to be more valuable to your customer by only allowing a limited number of them in circulation.
4.	Price Increase: high demand is forcing you to increase your price soon, but you’re giving people one last chance to order at your current prices. 
5.	PreOrdering: your product or service isn't available yet, but will be soon and you’re offering a special price or bonus for people who order before the launch date. 
6.	Coming Upgrade: you’re in the process of upgrading your product or service and this is their last chance to get the current version at the current price. 
7.	FOMO Factor: your PROMISE requires your prospect to buy your product or service before the DEADLINE. This is especially effective in the investment or biz opp niche when promoting “ground floor” type opportunities. 
NOTE: The example below uses the “FOMO Factor.”
Next, tell them that the above reason is how you ensure that your prospect experiences the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. Follow this with a “I’ve shared several reasons…” followed by a recap of your PROMISE or a reference to how they’re likely to feel after using or owning your product or service.
Next, remind them that if, after purchasing your OFFER and fulfilling the requirements for your guarantee, they feel like your OFFER wasn’t everything you claimed it would be, that you’ll honor your RISK REMOVAL offer. 
Finish with a statement like “If ___, here’s…” to transition to your Call to Action. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Why Can’t I Apply After the 30 Day Deadline?
If you’re still reading, you’re probably eager to get in on this ground floor opportunity. 
But you might also be wondering why we’re in such a hurry to get you on board. Maybe you’ve had a bad experience with a similar opportunity that wasn’t everything you expected it to be.
I understand. I’ve suffered my share of blistering disappointments from acting quickly on investment opportunities that failed to live up to their potential. 
That’s why I want you to know, before starting, that this urgent timeline is necessary for your success. Over the next several months, this business opportunity will become the next big trend, and hundreds of thousands of people will be flocking to it. 
When that happens, the ground floor opportunity will be gone, and only the people who started early will hit the big jackpot. That’s why we created the 30 day deadline.  
I’ve shared several reasons why I’m confident that you’ll look back on this as one of the smartest and most profitable investments you’ve ever made. 
But if at ANY time after getting involved, you feel that this opportunity wasn’t everything you expected, I’ll gladly refund your money and mail you an Amazon gift card worth $100, just to make up for your time.
If this is reasonable and you’re ready to start, here’s the next step...
***********************************END************************************



 
Offer Stack (Working) 
Offer Stack Prompts: 
Now use these instructions to write the copy for our Offer Stack. This Offer Stack copy MUST be consistent with what’s in the copy we’ve already created for this funnel. 
Our Offer Stack message will include the following elements:
1.	Introduction
2.	Value Stacking
3.	Price Reveal
4.	Guarantee
5.	Urgency
These five elements are the secret ingredients to making this equation work:
Perceived Value > Perceived Cost
The “Introduction” should make our OFFER and PROMISE 100% clear. 
The “Value Stacking” element should dramatically elevate their perceived value of our OFFER. 
The “Price Reveal” element diminishes their perceived financial cost of our OFFER. 
The “Guarantee” should diminish the perceived intangible (time, energy, disappointment, etc) cost of our OFFER. 
The “Urgency” element should push our prospect to take action and buy now, instead of later. 
In some cases (which I’ll explain in the instructions for the “Price Reveal” element), we’ll present the “Guarantee” before the “Price Reveal.”
Create the messages (including their individual formula variations) for these elements ONE AT A TIME, and wait for my approval on one element before continuing to the next one. 
Element #1: Introduction
Please create one version of our introduction for each of the following formulas, and include the “NOTE” for each one. 
FORMULA #1: Claim + Deliverables
NOTE: This formula works best for multimedia information products. 
Start with a statement like “[PRODUCT/SERVICE] is the best (see my Super Seven in Chapter XI) [SOLUTION]...” for solving the PROBLEM and/or achieving the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. Follow this claim with a short summary of the deliverables in your OFFER stack, as in the example below. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The Antifragile Sales System is the most comprehensive training course on the market for becoming a master entrepreneur. You’ll get over 300 training videos, a monthly newsletter, three dynamic software programs for managing your projects, your finances and your marketing campaigns PLUS access to our member’s only forum.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #2: Price of Creation
NOTE: This formula works best when your AUDIENCE has a hard time appreciating the amount of time, money, energy, and human capital that went into creating your product or service. For example, if you’re a specialist who delivers a lot of value in just one hour because you bring decades of experience or expertise to that hour, or if you deliver a product that costs very little to deliver, but that required a lot of time, money, creativity, experience, expertise, and research, to create. 
Introduce your product or service by name, followed by “[NAME] is the result of…” followed by a summary of the cost of developing and/or delivering your OFFER. This can include the years or decades that went into developing it. Tell them how much money and time was spent on research, experimentation, expert guidance, input from the AUDIENCE'S peers, and anything else that’s valuable and relevant. 
Transition to the Value Stacking element of Offer Stack by telling them that you’re about to offer it all to them either:
1.	As a private invitation (limited access). 
2.	For a special price (with limited time or supply). 
3.	At no risk (foreshadowing your guarantee).
Which one will depend on which human need your OFFER appeals to. If your OFFER appeals to the need for Validation or Purpose, use the private invitation transition. If your offer appeals to the need for Excitement, use the special price transition. If your OFFER appeals to the need for Security, use the “at no risk…” transition. We’ll cover these human needs in detail in Chapter XI. The example below uses the “at no risk…” transition. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The Antifragile Sales System" is the result of over 20 years of experience working one on one with multi-millionaire and billionaire entrepreneurs. I’ve invested over $80,000.00 in training tools, and spent countless hours of trial and error to perfect this one-of-a-kind system that I’m about to present to you at absolutely no risk.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #3: Audience Relevance
NOTE: This formula works best for high-end services that require a lot of nuanced customization. For example, if you’re selling a coaching program that teaches men in their late 40s or 50s to go from good physical shape to elite physical shape or a B2B service that’s optimized for a specific type of business or industry.  
Start with a statement like “[PRODUCT/SERVICE] is the best (see my Super Seven in Chapter XI) [SOLUTION] for [AUDIENCE] who want…” to solve the PROBLEM and/or achieve the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The Antifragile Sales System" is the world’s first and ONLY cloud based, intuitive business management system made specifically for internet marketers who want to create and market their own high quality information products and build an online business they can walk away from without losing money.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #4: Social Proof
NOTE: This formula works best for products and services with a broad social appeal. However, don’t use this formula if you’re claiming to help achieve a result that only a small select group of the population ever achieves. For example, if you’re selling a product or services that promises the secret to getting rich, getting into elite physical shape, or attracting a lot of attention and interest from the opposite sex, etc.
Start with a statement like “[PRODUCT/SERVICE] is used/preferred by more than [#] [AUDIENCE] who want…” to solve the PROBLEM and/or achieve the PROMISE by the DEADLINE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. If applicable, tell them how many languages it’s been translated into, how many countries it’s currently being sold or used in, and/or the variety of audiences (industries in B2B) it’s used by. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Introducing "The Antifragile Sales System," the negotiation course used by more than one hundred thousand sales people across the world. It’s been translated into 10 different languages and sold in over 50 different countries.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #5: USP 
NOTE: This formula works best in saturated markets where prospects are likely to assume that they can get the “same thing” from a competitor. 
Start with a statement like “[PRODUCT/SERVICE] is the only [SOLUTION]…” followed by a brief summary of the USP you introduced in your Offer Positioning message. Follow this with one of the following types of statements:
1.	The mind(s) behind your product or service. 
2.	An open challenge or dare to your competitors.
3.	How your USP answers the EXTERNAL and/or INTERNAL OBJECTION(S).
Which one will depend on the buying preferences of your AUDIENCE, and the type of product or service you’re promoting. If you’re competing in a market with a lot of self-proclaimed experts, use the first statement. If you’re marketing in a highly competitive market where your prospect’s are likely to be trying a product or service like yours for the first time, use the second. If you’re marketing to an AUDIENCE who has been repeatedly let down by competitors or by ALTERNATIVES, use the third. The example below uses the first type of statement.   
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The Antifragile Productivity System" is the only personal growth product which teaches a science based strategy for mastering the core skills of an entrepreneur. This System was specifically designed by an entrepreneur and an expert in human behavior and peak performance.
***********************************END************************************
Element #2: Value Stacking 
Now that we’ve introduced our Offer Stack, it’s time to pump up our prospect’s perceived value of it. We do this by listing everything they’ll get when they purchase our OFFER, laying out the BENEFITS of each item, connecting those BENEFITS to our larger PROMISE, assigning a dollar value to each item, and finishing with a bonus stack that overcomes our prospect’s EXTERNAL and INTERNAL OBJECTIONS. Ideally, you want your OFFER to include one bonus for overcoming each of the following objections:
●	Time Objection
●	Money Objection
●	Social Objection 
●	EXTERNAL OBJECTION
●	INTERNAL OBJECTION
The order in which you introduce these isn’t important. By “Social Objection,” I mean any fears your AUDIENCE might have about family, friends, coworkers, or peers who might keep them from using and/or benefitting from your OFFER. This can also include any fear that someone might judge them for buying or owning what you’re offering. 
Start your Value Stacking message with a “Here’s What You’ll Get When You [ACTION] Today…” subheader. The remainder of your Value Stacking message should follow the formula below. 
First, you’ll get [Name of your main deliverable here]. This is a [tell them what main deliverable is] that [tell them how it solves the PROBLEM and/or achieves the PROMISE] so you can stop [emotional pain points of the SYMPTOM this deliverable solves] and [emotional benefits of the promised result]. 
This is a total value of [dollar value of main deliverable here].
You’ll also get [Name of your next deliverable here]. This is a [tell them what this deliverable is] that [tell them how it solves the PROBLEM and/or achieves the PROMISE] so you can stop [emotional pain points of the SYMPTOM this deliverable solves] and [emotional benefits of the promised result]. 
This is a total value of [dollar value of the deliverable here]. So you'll be getting [recap each deliverable introduced so far, including their dollar values], for a total value of [running total of all deliverables introduced so far] when you [action you’ll be asking them to take] today.
*Repeat the above two paragraphs until you’ve listed all your deliverables*
Next, use a “But That’s Not All, [ACTION] and Get These Bonuses…” or “PLUS, [ACTION] and Get These Bonuses…”  subheader to introduce your bonuses. 
Next, you’ll get [name of the bonus that overcomes your prospect’s time objection]. This is a [tell them what this bonus is] that [tell them how it overcomes their time objection] so you [PROMISE] in [DEADLINE] and [emotional benefits of the promised result]. 
This is a total value of [dollar value of the time objection bonus]. So you'll be getting [recap each bonus introduced so far, including their dollar values], for a total value of [running total of all bonuses introduced so far] when you [action you’ll be asking them to take] today.
Repeat the above two paragraphs for the bonuses that overcome your prospect’s primary money objection(s), social objection(s), EXTERNAL OBJECTION(S), and INTERNAL OBJECTION(S). The example below includes a bonus for each of these objections, just in a different order. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************

***********************************END************************************
Element #3: Price Reveal 
Your Price Reveal message should make your OFFER price seem like a steal, but not too much of a steal. If your price seems too low, you’ll awaken a “this seems too good to be true…” skepticism in your prospect that will make them less likely to become a customer. I’ve included the ten most effective Price Reveal formulas below, along with a note about when to use them, and an example. 
Please create one version of our Price Reveal message for each of the following formulas, and include the “NOTE” for each one. 
FORMULA #1: Cost of Development
NOTE: This formula works best when your AUDIENCE has a hard time appreciating the amount of time, money, energy, and human capital that went into creating your product or service. For example, if you’re a specialist who delivers a lot of value in just one hour because you bring decades of experience or expertise to that hour, or if you deliver a product that costs very little to deliver, but that required a lot of time, money, creativity, experience, expertise, and research, to create. 
Use a “[NAME] has taken me/us…” or “[NAME] costs us...”followed by a summary of the cost of developing and/or delivering your OFFER. This can include the years or decades that went into developing it, as well as the time, money, and expertise invested into research, experimentation, any input from the AUDIENCE'S peers, and anything else that’s valuable and relevant. Follow this up by using a “But, when you [ACTION] today, it’s your for just [PRICE].” Finish with a “That’s less than…” statement that makes your price sound like a short term sacrifice and your OFFER sound like a long-term investment. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The Antifragile Copywriting System has taken me over 15 years to develop, test, refine, and perfect. Today, it’s yours for a one time investment of just $497. 
That’s less than what you’ll spend on meals out next month, and you’re getting something far, far more valuable in return. You’re getting a proven system that will reward you with HUGE increases in traffic, leads, sales, and profits…for the rest of your life.  
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #2: Cost of DIY
NOTE: This formula works best in markets with a lot of DIY ALTERNATIVES. The idea being to show your prospect how costly it would be for them to try and replace your product by doing it themselves or by hiring someone else to do it. 
Start by summarizing the total cost of your prospect trying to solve their PROBLEM or achieve the BENEFIT on their own. This can include the years or decades they would spend, as well as the time, money, and expertise you’ve invested into research, experimentation, input from the AUDIENCE'S peers, and anything else that’s valuable and relevant. Follow this up by using a “But, when you [ACTION] today, it’s yours for just [PRICE]” or “I/We can save you all this time, money, and experimentation, and trouble by giving it to you for just [PRICE.” Finish with a “This means that for…” statement that breaks your price down into smaller increments, followed by a restatement of how your OFFER solves the PROBLEM and/or achieve the PROMISE. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Learning these copywriting skills on your own could cost you $5,000, $10,000, even up to $20,000…and that’s just to get your hands on a big mess of swipe files and techniques that you’d have to search through and organize every time you write a new sales letter.
I'll make your life easy and give you 60 days of risk free access to “The Antifragile Marketing Letter” for a simple payment of only $29 a month. 
This means that for a measly .99 a day, you can have instant access to a toolbox of swipe and deploy copywriting techniques and put a stop to low conversions and writing anxiety starting today.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #3: Cost of the PROBLEM
NOTE: This formula works best when your prospect’s PROBLEM has a high physical, financial, social, and/or emotional cost. 
Start with a statement like “The great news is that instead of…” or “And the best part is that instead of…” followed by a summary of all the costs of the PROBLEM and its SYMPTOMS. These costs can include financial costs, time costs, emotional costs, and any other relevant costs. Finish this sentence with a statement like “you can [ACTION] and get [PRODUCT NAME]…” or “you can try[PRODUCT NAME] …” for just [PRICE]. Finish your Price Reveal with a “that’s a small price to pay for…” followed by a statement about overcoming the PROBLEM and/or experiencing the PROMISE.  
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The great news is that instead of missing out on half your potential traffic, more than half of your potential leads, and continuing to get price resistance and “let me think about” objections on sales calls, you can now try “The Copywriting Cure” RISK FREE for a full 60 days for a single installment of just $899!
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #4: Guarantee Reminder
NOTE: This formula works best when your AUDIENCE has a lot of anxiety or hesitation about taking the final step by handing you money 
Start with any of the other Price Reveal formulas in this section. However, instead of putting the price into context at the end, restate your GUARANTEE and your RISK REMOVAL(S). Be sure and tell them the CONDITIONS of your GUARANTEE, just as I’ve done by telling them to mail the course back in the example below. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Guitar God Mastery Course” could save you $3,000, $5,000 or $10,000 on private guitar lessons over the next 5 years. And today, you can get it rushed to your door for one simple investment of just $599. 
Remember, your investment is backed up by a full 90 day money back guarantee. If at any time during the next 90 days, you’re not 100% convinced that “Guitar God Mastery Course,” is the fastest way to master the guitar, just mail the course back to us for a full refund. If this sounds reasonable, here’s how to get started. 
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #5: Appeal to Sophistication
NOTE: This formula works best for products or services that appeal to status or to your AUDIENCE’S sense of superiority in owning, or using your product or service. For example, if you’re selling wine to experienced wine tasters, or paintings to art enthusiasts, or a high-end copywriting course for advanced copywriters. Our goal is to make our prospect feel that objecting to our price would make them cheap or unsophisticated. 
Start with a statement like “It takes a smart (sophisticated, experienced, etc) [AUDIENCE] to appreciate…” or “not everyone understands the true quality (beauty, sophistication, etc)...” of a great (authentic, handmade, etc.) [SOLUTION]...” followed by the claim that not everyone will get the BENEFIT of becoming a customer.  
Next, use the same formula that we used to debunk ALTERNATIVE solutions to emphasize how your brand product or service is superior to competitors. Finish with a “Why [NEGATIVE], when you can [POSITIVE]...” question that contrasts your product or service with cheaper competitors. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
It takes an intelligent watch owner to appreciate the value of an authentic, hand-crafted wooden watch, so we realize that not everyone will get to own one. But if you’re ready to become one of only 100 proud owners of this limited edition Red Neo timepiece your total price is $22,499.00.   
We’re aware that other watchmakers promote their own limited edition collections, and for less money. What they don’t tell you is that their watch parts are made in the same boilerplate factories as watches you’d buy at Walmart or Target.  
Why waste your money on cheap imitations when you can own a watch that sets you apart as a true fan of hand-made artistry and makes you the proud owner of something that will NEVER be available to the public again? 
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #6: Payment Plan
NOTE: This formula works best for high-end products and services promoted to an AUDIENCE who either don’t have the immediate funds to purchase, or who want to start seeing results before they pay the full amount (as in the example below). 
Start with a reference to past clients who solved the PROBLEM and achieved the PROMISE using your product or service. Make the claims about their results as concrete as possible. Claims about ROI work best, but you can also appeal to money your customers have saved or other quantifiable results. Next, use a “Today, you can get started for just [#] payments of…” or “For [#] simple payments of just…you can [PROMISE] in [DEADLINE].” This works best when you can remind them that the DEADLINE of your PROMISE will come before their final payment, as I’ve done in the example below. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
The last 10 customers to join our Millionaire Makers Club have increased their monthly income from $30k or $50k a month to millions per year. For three simple payments of just $39,997.00, you can join them. By the time your final payment is due, your investment will likely have paid for itself 5-10 times over.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #7: Appeal to Competition
NOTE: This formula works best when your PROMISE (not your product or service) has a high social value. For example, if you're selling a Body Recomposition Program to men who want to gain muscle and be the biggest guy at their gym, or athletes who want to dominate their competition and impress their fans.
Start with a reference to other members of your AUDIENCE who are already getting the result your prospect wants. Follow this with an “If you have what it takes…” dare that challenges your prospect to join this group of winners, and finishes with a “you’ll be glad (happy, excited, etc) to hear that your investment is only [PRICE].”
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Hundreds of men your age are already packing on tens of pounds of lean, ripped muscle using this elite body recomposition program. If you have what it takes to become one of them, you’ll be glad to hear that your full investment is only $2997 to start today. 
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #8: No Hidden Fees
NOTE: This formula works best when your type of product or service typically comes with a lot of unexpected fees or expenses. 
Start with “Other [product or service type here] will cost you…” followed by a list of all the extra charges that typically come with a product or service like yours. Follow this by telling them that if they take action and buy today, they’ll get [list all your deliverables here] for just [PRICE]. Finish by restating your PROMISE and DEADLINE, and adding a “with no…” followed by either “for good…” or list of typical charges. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Other home security systems could cost you $500, $600, up to $750 for equipment, installation, monthly monitoring, and dozens of tiny “gotcha” charges that add up like the death of a thousand paperwork cuts. 
Today, “Super Security” can be in your home and protecting you and your family, with no installation cost, no monthly monitoring fees and no laundry list of mysterious charges. Just a one-time installment of $300 and your home security problems are solved for good.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #9: Reveal and Review
NOTE: This formula works best for Trip-Wire offers with a lot of deliverables and/or bonuses. 
Start with “And the best part is…” or “And the easy part is…” followed by a reminder of they get the product (“...[PRODUCT NAME] can be rushed to your door for just…” or “...you can get instant access to [PRODUCT NAME] in the next 2 minutes for only…”, etc.), followed by your price. Follow this up by comparing your price to another higher price (“That’s less than [higher price here] for…”) and then restating all your deliverables, including bonuses. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
And the best part is, “The Antifragile Marketing Library” can be rushed to your door for a simple yearly subscription fee of just $99. 
That’s less than $10 a month to have loads of fresh copywriting headlines, templates, industry specific research and in-depth articles and interviews with self-made entrepreneurs delivered directly to your front door step every month for a full year.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #10: “What's it Worth to ___?”
NOTE: This formula works best when your prospect’s PROBLEM has a long-term impact, or the PROMISE has a high long-term payoff. This is especially effective if the cost of the PROBLEM or the BENEFIT of the PROMISE is mainly emotional (see my discussion of Human Needs in Chapter XI).  
Start with a “What’s it worth to…” followed by all the social and emotional BENEFITS of the PROMISE you’re making to your prospect. Follow this up with a “I’m sure you’ll agree that it’s priceless” or “You can’t put a price on any of these and shouldn’t have to.” Finish with a “That’s we’re making it easy…” or “That’s why we’re offering…” followed by your price. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
What’s it worth to lose those extra 20, 30 or 50 lbs and restore your energy, confidence, and mental sharpness? 
What’s it worth to rest your head on your pillow at night, knowing you’ll be safe from the high cost of long-term health problems? 
What’s it worth to buy back years, or decades that you could spend watching your grandkids grow up, and enjoying the fruits of your labor with the people you love? 
I’m sure you’ll agree that it’s priceless. That’s why we’re making it easy for you to start protecting this bright future today with a one time investment of just $499.
***********************************END************************************
Element #4: Guarantee
There are few things marketers kick, scream, whine, stamp their feet, and cry about more than my advice to create a rock-solid Guarantee. The point of a Guarantee is to take the risk off your customer’s shoulders and place it on yours. Offering money back doesn’t cut it. Your prospect is also investing their time, energy, and hope into buying and using your product or service. This is why you need two types of Guarantees. The first to make up for the money they’ve spent on your OFFER, the second to make up for their time. Here’s the most common objection I hear to this advice:
“We can’t promise anything if they don’t use it!”
Of course you can’t. I’d never advise you to give someone a refund just because they ask for one. In fact, I honestly believe that if someone doesn’t use your product or service, they don’t deserve to keep the money they spent on it. I consider it a non-redeemable tax on laziness, and that money is better off in the hands of someone who will use it responsibly. I could go on a Lord of the Rings length rant about all the reasons you shouldn't give refunds to anyone who asks for one. 
The one exception to this is if they use your product or service as directed, and don’t get the result you’ve promised. This is the ONLY time you should honor your Guarantee and Risk Removal offer. That said, I strongly suggest you backup your PROMISE with two RISK REMOVAL offers. The first to make up for their money spent, and the second to make up for their time. For example, I offer $500 to anyone who reads and uses this book and doesn’t honestly feel that it’s the most effective AI Funnel Copywriting they’ve ever read. This does NOT mean I’ll give $500 to anyone who emails me making such a claim. I’m going to ask them specific questions to see whether they’ve read and used what I advise in this book. I’m also going to ask them which book they found to be more effective, and proof of the results they got applying what they learned in that book. If they can’t answer these questions and show evidence that my advice failed to deliver, I assume they either didn’t read or didn’t use the book and are just out to make a quick $500. 
Bottom line, bold Guarantees should always come with conditions for your prospect to use what they’ve bought. If they do, and they don’t experience the result you’ve promised, only then are you responsible for making it up to them. Otherwise, they’re responsible for their lack of results, and you have a right to keep their money. I’m sure this will offend some sensitive readers. But if you understand and apply this advice, your sheer volume of sales will more than make up for any RISK REMOVAL offers you have to honor. 
The Guarantee formula is simple. Just state your Guarantee, and tell that you’re offering it for one of the following reasons:
1.	You’re confident that it will deliver on your PROMISE. 
2.	You want your prospect to be confident in their purchase. 
Finally, use an “If ___, then___ “ statement to anchor the CONDITIONS of your Guarantee to your RISK REMOVAL offers, as I’ve done in both the examples below. 
Please create one version of our Guarantee message for each of the example types below. 
Here’s an example using the first Guarantee reason. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Finally, we’re so confident that "The Antifragile Marketing Library" will boost your new sales by at least 100% over the next 30 days, we’re protecting your purchase 100% money back guarantee. 
Just use the Marketing Library as directed for the next 90 days, and keep track of your results so we can review them if needed. 
If at ANY time in the next 30 days, you believe "Copywriting Magic" isn’t for you, simply send it back for a FULL refund. You can keep the bonuses!
***********************************END************************************
Here’s an example using the second Guarantee reason. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Finally, since we want you to be 100% confident in your decision to try "The Antifragile Marketing Library," we’re protecting your investment with a 100% money back guarantee, PLUS we’ll give you a $100 gift card to make up for your time.
Just use the Marketing Library as directed for the next 90 days, and keep track of your results so we can review them if needed. 
If at ANY time in the next 30 days, you believe "Copywriting Magic" isn’t for you, simply send it back for a FULL refund. You can keep the bonuses!
***********************************END************************************
Element #5: Urgency
Procrastination exists. Therefore Urgency must exist in your Offer Stack and your Post CTA (Call to Action) message. There are two ways to create urgency in your sales copy: 
1.	External Pressure
2.	Internal Pressure 
External pressure comes from making an irresistible limited-time (or limited supply/space) OFFER. Internal pressure is more complicated, but also more powerful. In fact, if you create enough internal pressure, your limited-time OFFER will become much, much more effective. We’ll discuss Internal Pressure in the next chapter when I introduce Post CTA Formulas. In my experience, there are three effective formulas for creating External Pressure. 
Please create one version of our Urgency message for each of the following formulas, and include the “NOTE” for each one. 
FORMULA #1: Limited Time
NOTE: This formula works best when your OFFER is limited by a deadline. 
Start with a “stop word” (Warning, Alert, Important, Wait, etc.) and tell them exactly when their OFFER expires. Use the word “your…” when restating the discount, bonus, or other details of your OFFER, as I’ve done in the example below. 
Finish with a bold statement of exactly what will happen if they order past the deadline. This last part is damn important, and something a lot of marketers are too timid to include. Do it. You’ll make more sales. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
WARNING: Your discount on The Antifragile Sales System expires in 72 hours from now. If your order is received later than the deadline, your order will be canceled and your payment refunded.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #2: Limited Supply
NOTE: This formula works best when your OFFER is limited by space or supply.  
Start with a “stop word” (Warning, Alert, Important, Wait, etc.) and tell them the exact number of people who will get the OFFER before it’s gone. Use the word “your…” when restating the discount, bonus, or other details of your OFFER, as I’ve done in the example below. Finish with a bold statement of exactly what will happen if they order after supply or space runs out. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
IMPORTANT: Your 70% discount is only available to the first 100 customers to order. 
Act before leaving this site or your copy of The Antifragile Mastermind System will be passed to the next person in line.
***********************************END************************************
FORMULA #3: Reason for Removal
NOTE: This formula works best when you plan to take your OFFER down at some undefined point in the near future.  
Start with a “stop word” (Warning, Alert, Important, Wait, etc.) and tell them the reason you could be taking the OFFER down in the near future, or at an unexpected time. Use the word “your…” when recapping any discounts, bonus, or other details of your OFFER, as I’ve done in the example below. Finish with a bold statement about the cost of coming back and finding the OFFER gone forever. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
ALERT: Grab this risk free offer right now because 2 major financial institutions already have their eye on this system and any day now I might be forced to take this offer down. 
If you don’t act now, you might have to regret it when you come back to find this page gone forever.
***********************************END************************************



 
CTA and Post CTA (Working) 
 
CTA 
Call to Action Prompt:
Now write my Call to Action (CTA) message. This Call to Action MUST be consistent with what’s in the copy we’ve already created for this funnel. Make sure all these Calls to Action variations include these four elements:
1.	Tell them the exact action they need to take
2.	Tell them exactly what will happen next
3.	Restate your promise and deadline
4.	Restate your guarantee and risk removal
Use the formulas behind the examples below to create one version of my Call to Action message for each example.

Objections 
Objections Prompts:
Now write my Objections Messages. These Objections messages MUST be consistent with what’s in the copy we’ve already created for this funnel. Make sure all these Objection messages include these four elements:
1.	Tell them the exact action they need to take
2.	Tell them exactly what will happen next
3.	Restate your promise and deadline
4.	Restate your guarantee and risk removal
Use the formulas below to create my Objections messages, and create each one at a time, waiting for my approval before moving on to the next. These Objection Formulas are useful for every type of funnel, but especially Retargeting Funnels. Their goal is to answer and dissolve any of your prospect’s last minute objections to your OFFER. I’ve narrowed the most common objections to these four:
1.	External: objections about your type of product or service. 
2.	Internal: objections about whether your PROMISE can actually happen for them or for their business.
3.	Commitment: objections about the time and/or action it will take for your prospect to achieve the PROMISE.
4.	Character: objections about whether you really care about their results, or just want to make a buck.
Formula #1: External Objections
An EXTERNAL OBJECTION is a worry, fear, or concern (rational or irrational) that your prospect has about an assumed hassle they associate with your type of product or service. Your job is to assure them that they’ll get your promised result without having to deal with it. 
Start this message with a subheader that describes the EXTERNAL OBJECTION in your prospect’s language, like this:
1.	“What About [EXTERNAL OBJECTION]?”
2.	“Will I Have to [EXTERNAL OBJECTION]?”
3.	“I Don’t Want [EXTERNAL OBJECTION]”
4.	“I Don’t Need More [EXTERNAL OBJECTION]”
Next, assume the sale with a statement like “Before you [ACTION], I/we want you to be 100% confident about…” followed by a reference to the feature of your product or service relevant to the objection (see the example below). 
Next, tell them that you and/or your team knows or understands what it’s like to deal with the hassle that your prospect is worried they’ll have to deal with. 
Next, demonstrate this understanding on a logical and emotional level, using a clear and concrete description of the hassle, and the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional cost of dealing with it. The purpose of this “mini-rant” is to demonstrate empathy, which is essential to the Character dimension of trust, that we discussed earlier. 
Next, use an “If ___, then ___” to connect their EXTERNAL OBJECTION to their hesitation to do business with you or the other competitors they’ve been considering (see the example below).  
Next, tell them that you (or the members of your team) have been in the same position when shopping for a similar product or service, and therefore understand. Follow this with a “That’s why I’ve/we’ve…” statement that tells them how you’ve gone out of your way to make sure your customers get to experience the PROMISE, without abovementioned hassle. 
Next, use a statement like “So before we welcome you as our new customer, just know that…” to assume the sale and group you (or your team) and the customer into one new “family.” Finish this statement with a simple metaphor or illustration that explains how it will be to use your product or service without the hassle. 
Finally, restate your GUARANTEE and RISK REMOVALS to remind them what you’ll do if your OFFER doesn’t live up to the claim you’ve just made. Use an “If ___, then ___” statement to transition either to your Offer Stack (for retargeting funnels) or your Call to Action (for all other funnels). 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
What About Service Interruptions?
Before we talk about moving forward with this, I want you to be 100% confident about how we welcome new customers. 
I KNOW how much of a hassle it can be to change over to ANY kind of new service provider. It could be changing phone services, replacing your virtual IT department, or upgrading or migrating to a new business management application.
Many times, these simple upgrades take longer than they should. They create loads of annoying and unnecessary work on your end. They lead to unexpected interruptions or lags in service which leave you making red-faced apologies to your customers. 
If you’ve been stuck with a mediocre SEO for a while now, it’s probably because you’d rather not invite this extra hassle into your business or your life. I understand. 
I’ve been in your shoes and I KNOW how important your customer relationships are to you. That’s why we’ve worked especially hard to make this part of our relationship surprisingly pleasant for you.
So before we get started, just know that making us your new SEO will be almost as simple as accepting a software upgrade by clicking “Yes” on your computer screen. 
If this sounds fair enough, here’s what you’ll be getting when you join us today…
***********************************END************************************
Formula #2: Internal Objections
An INTERNAL OBJECTION is a worry, fear, or concern (rational or irrational) your prospect has about whether your PROMISE can happen for them. Your job is to assure them that they’ll get your promised result, despite the thing that’s causing this doubt. Before we dive into the formula, let’s cover three important facts about this objection type. 
Firstly, while an INTERNAL OBJECTION is usually something common or even universal, your prospect usually believes it’s rare or even unique to them. This is damn important when you’re writing sales copy. 
If you nail their INTERNAL OBJECTION, your prospect will feel like you’re reading their mind. This dramatically boosts their perception of your Competence. It also demonstrates empathy, which is essential to the Character dimension of trust. 
In live selling situations, INTERNAL OBJECTIONS become trickier, and answering them can even trigger your prospect’s “this is just a salesperson telling me what I want to hear…” alarm. Sure, it can be done, but it’s an uphill battle. You’re better off answering this objection beforehand by addressing it in your copy. When you master this, you’ll be shocked at how much easier live selling situations become. 
Secondly, an INTERNAL OBJECTION is categorically different from an objection about whether your product or service actually works. An INTERNAL OBJECTION is anything that makes your prospect to say think: 
“I’m sure this works for other people, but it might not work for me because [insert INTERNAL OBJECTION here].”
Lastly, an INTERNAL OBJECTION isn’t actually about your product or service (although prospects often believe it is). It’s a fear or insecurity that your prospect has about themselves or their past or present experience with one or both of these two things:
1.	The PROBLEM and their attempts to solve it.
2.	The PROMISE and their attempts to achieve it.  
This is why I tell copywriters and sales people that they have two sales to make. The first sale is to convince your prospect that your product or service works. The second is to convince them that it will work for them. Those are vastly different objectives, and most marketers and salespeople don’t understand the difference. 
Start this message with a subheader that describes the INTERNAL OBJECTION in your prospect’s language, like this:
1.	“What if I [INTERNAL OBJECTION]?”
2.	“Does This Work if [INTERNAL OBJECTION]?”
3.	“This Sounds Great, But [INTERNAL OBJECTION]”
4.	“I Don’t Want to [INTERNAL OBJECTION] Again” 
Next, use a statement like “If you’re still reading (listening, etc), it means…” followed by a confirmation of the hope that they have about your OFFER and your PROMISE. Keep in mind that hope is not the same thing as belief. We’re confirming their hope so that we can turn it into belief. 
Contrast this with a “But you’re probably also thinking about…” or “But you might also be secretly thinking…” followed by a description of their INTERNAL OBJECTION. If this description matches your prospect’s internal dialogue, even better. 
Next, use the “Feel, Felt Found” formula to assure them that you and your other customers understand what it’s like to have that worry, and to even have it come true. 
Use your “feel” statement to make a clear and concrete description of the disappointing experiences your prospect either fears, dreads having, or has heard about others having. The purpose of this “mini-rant” is to demonstrate empathy, which is essential to the Character dimension of trust, that we discussed earlier. 
Use a “Sound familiar? You’re not alone…” combination to transition to your “felt” statement.
Use your “felt” statement to assure your prospect that many (not all, or you’ll create skepticism) your customers felt exactly the same way before using your product or service. Include a few examples of these customer’s “underdog” success stories to support this point. 
Next, tell your prospect that all these customers “found” that the thing they feared would stop them (INTERNAL OBJECTION) either turned into an advantage, or was nullified by some feature of your product or service. If this feature is your USP, all the better. 
Follow this with a “That’s why I’ve/we’ve…” statement that reminds them of your GUARANTEE and RISK REMOVALS if your OFFER doesn’t live up to the claim you’ve just made. Use an “If ___, then ___” statement to transition either to your Offer Stack (for retargeting funnels) or your Call to Action (for all other funnels). 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
This Sounds Great, But I’ve Hired Coaches Before…
Right now, you’re probably thinking that our Mastermind Program sounds like just the answer you’ve been hoping for. 
But you might also have a secret fear that this will turn out like all the other coaching programs you’ve joined in the past. 
I understand how you feel. You hire an expert, or a marketing agency, and they promise you the world. The first few weeks are great. 
Then, things take a dreadful turn. 
You’re not getting results. Your “expert” coaches start making excuses. 
They stop responding to your emails, or (worse) start sending canned “copy and paste” responses to your valid concerns. 
Next thing you know, you’re fighting with them over whether you should keep paying for their “services.” 
Sound familiar? 
You’re not alone. 
Dozens of my clients felt the same way when they came to me. In fact, my client Dan dumped more than $500k into ad agencies before we finally got him past the six figure barrier and made seven figures. 
My client Melanie maxed out her last credit card to work with me, after paying $100k+ to “expert” coaches who didn’t take the time to understand her brand voice, or business goals. 
She’s now recouped her $100k, and her investment in our program, and just had her first $120k month. 
I could tell you dozens more success stories, but all these clients found one thing when working with me. They found that making a sustainable seven figures a year starts with embracing complexity, and applying a system that’s both customizable, and based on sound marketing fundamentals.
This is the ONLY Mastermind Program in the world based on such a system, and I’ve shown you this system in detail earlier in this video. That’s why I’m offering to refund 100% of your money AND give you an extra $1,000 if you use this program and it doesn’t live up to these promises.  
If this sounds reasonable, here’s how to get started…
***********************************END************************************
Formula #3: Commitment Objections
This objection is simple. Your prospect has questions or doubts about whether the time and/or action required to achieve the PROMISE is either:
1.	Too much to ask
2.	Too good to be true
Let me start by cautioning you about the “too much to ask” prospects. You might not want these prospects to buy from you at all. This is especially true if you’re marketing a service that requires your clients cooperation to achieve the PROMISE. The desire for fast results is often a symptom of prioritizing ease and urgency over diligence and value. Customers who think like that don’t need to be persuaded to think differently. They need a paradigm shift. Even trained counselors have a hard time pulling this off, and that’s assuming they have the client’s full cooperation. 
Even if you persuade these prospects to become customers, their persistent need for instant gratification will drag your relationship  into a cesspool of indecision, micromanagement, and the constant overstepping of your boundaries. One toxic can chew up more operational and emotional bandwidth than several good clients ever would. They also tend to be cheap, impulsive, and highly susceptible to any and all shiny object offers from your competitors. 
I suggest using the Qualification section of your Positioning message (see Chapter VII) and this Commitment Objection message to weed these prospects out. Any money they pay you won’t be worth the drain on you and your team. Other than that, answering commitment objections is all about clarifying expectations. 
Since you’ll have some prospects who think the required commitment is too good to be true, and others who think it's too much to ask, I suggest answering them both, starting with the most common. In most cases, the “too good to be true” is more common, but the Scientific Split-Testing strategy in Chapter XI will tell you for sure. 
Start your “too good to be true” section with a subheader like:
1.	“[DEADLINE] Seems too Good to Be True”
2.	“Can I Really [PROMISE] in [DEADLINE]?”
Next, use an “If __, then __” statement to affirm your prospect’s skepticism.  
Next, use the “Feel, Felt Found” formula to assure them that you and your other customers felt the same way at first. Use your “feel” statement to make a clear and concrete description of why they had this doubt. Describe a few past disappointments or horror stories that made you or your clients have this skepticism. 
Next, use an “If __, then __” statement to affirm that it’s normal for them to be skeptical. 
Use your “felt” statement to assure your prospect that many (not all, or you’ll create skepticism) your customers felt exactly the same way about the required commitment before using your product or service. Include a few examples of these customer’s “underdog” success stories to support this point. 
Next, tell your prospect that all these customers “found” that a certain feature of your product or service makes it possible to achieve the PROMISE anyway. If this feature is your USP, all the better. 
Follow this with a “That’s why I’ve/we’ve…” statement that reminds them of your GUARANTEE and RISK REMOVALS if your OFFER doesn’t live up to the claim you’ve just made. 
Start your “too much to ask” section with a subheader like:
1.	“I Don’t Want to Wait Until [DEADLINE]” 
2.	“Can it Happen Faster Than [DEADLINE]?”
Next, use an “If __, then __” statement to disqualify any prospects with unreasonable expectations.  
Next, reference a common MYTH that likely created this false expectation. Use the Myth-Busting Formula from Chapter IV to debunk this myth and warn of its dangers. Give vivid concrete descriptions of the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional pain caused by this MYTH. 
Finish with a “fork in the road” statement that contrasts the pain of continuing to fall for this MYTH with your PROMISE and its physical, financial, social, and/or emotional benefits. 
After you’ve answered the “too good to be true” and “too much to ask” sides of this objection, use an “If ___, then ___” statement to transition either to your Offer Stack (for retargeting funnels) or your Call to Action (for all other funnels). 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
Can I Really Break The 7 Figure Mark in Just 12 Months?
If you’re asking this, you’re not alone. 
Most of my clients feel the same way when they start our program. 
Some of them spend ten years or more trying to break the seven figure mark, working 80 or 90 hours a week, dumping time, money, and energy into coaching programs to squeeze out a few droplets of growth. 
If that’s been your experience, I can see why 12 months seems unrealistic. 
Dozens of my clients felt the same way when they came to me. In fact, my client Dan spent more than five years working with ad agencies before we finally got him past the six figure barrier and made seven figures, and it happened in just 14 months. 
My client Melanie maxed out her last credit card to work with me, after three years of paying $100k+ to “expert” coaches who didn’t take the time to understand her brand voice, or business goals. 
She’s been with us just 11 months now, and she’s already recouped her $100k, and her investment in our program, and had her first $120k month. 
I could tell you dozens more success stories, but all these clients found one thing when working with me. They found that scaling to a  sustainable seven figures a year doesn’t have to take years. What it takes is a system that’s both customizable, and based on sound marketing fundamentals.
This is the ONLY Mastermind Program in the world based on such a system, and I’ve shown you this system in detail earlier in this video. 
That’s why I’ve offered to refund 100% of your money and pay you $500 for your time if you’re not absolutely convinced after using this program for 90 days.
Can I Get There Faster Than 12 Months?
If you’re asking this, you might not be ready for this program. 
I understand how you feel. You want results, and you want them fast. You’ve probably seen videos online about people who grew million dollar businesses in just a few weeks working from their spare bedroom. 
Now they’re all selling products that promise the same kind of results. What you haven’t heard is that most of these stories are gimmicks to get you to buy their product. 
I know. I was a freelance direct response copywriter for 13 years. I got at least a dozen requests a week from self-proclaimed millionaire “entrepreneurs” asking for my help. 
Most of them couldn’t afford a lousy $500 retainer. 
Think about all the money you’ve peeled out of your bank account buying what these people are selling. 
Think about the blistering disappointments of pouring hours of your life chasing shortcuts and “secrets” made up by people who learned those “secrets” from other so-called experts.
The choice is simple…burn more years and waste more money chasing promises of overnight success, or join this program and enjoy long term, sustainable success in just 12 months. 
If the second option sounds better, here’s what you’ll get when you sign up today…
***********************************END************************************
Formula #4: Character Objections
This objection is when your prospect is skeptical of your motives as a marketer. Let me start by clarifying the difference between a skeptical prospect and a cynical prospect. Skeptical prospects are genuinely interested in your PROMISE and just have a few last minute questions. These prospects are worth persuading. Cynical prospects are not. I discovered this difference when I was building and managing high-ticket sales call centers. Skeptical prospects would ask questions, and if they were satisfied with the answers, they’d become clients, and good ones. 
Cynical prospects, however, aren’t looking for answers. They’re searching for reasons to say no. They’ll hound you with questions until they find these reasons, and if they don’t find them, they’ll make them up by twisting or distorting your answers. Many times, they won’t buy, and if they do, they’ll be the most likely to complain, to demand more than what they’ve paid for, or even demand a refund, only to trash your reputation on social media or a review site. 
Cynical people are determined to be happy and to validate their chronic unhappiness as the “right” view of the world. They spend their energy searching for ways to justify their unhappiness. If they don’t find any, they invent reasons out of thin air and they turn people and businesses into targets in the process. In my opinion, no self-respecting sales person or marketer should waste their time trying to persuade a cynical prospect. As Jesus said, don’t cast pearls before swine. 
I said all that to say this  formula isn’t designed to persuade the cynical. It’s designed for skeptical prospects who just need a shift in focus. At this stage of your funnel, you should have already answered your prospect’s Character objections. Now you’ll simply address their last minute objections by turning their focus back on what your OFFER will do for them. This will make a reasonable prospect set their fear aside and make the decision that best serves their interests. If this doesn’t work, you either didn’t address this objection early enough in your funnel, or your prospect is cynical and not worth turning into a customer.  
BTW, before I show you this formula, let’s clear up a gross misunderstanding about its origins. It’s not mine. It’s also not Russel Brunson's who, in my opinion, unethically claims credit for it. Dan S Kennedy is the earliest copywriter I saw sharing this formula, and even he admits that it might have come from an old school direct response ad, but that he can’t quite remember. The important point is that it’s damn effective. 
Start this message with a subheader that describes the objection your prospect’s language, like this:
1.	“Aren’t You Just Trying to Make Money With This?”
2.	“If You Really Want to Help, Why Isn’t This Free?”
3.	“Aren’t You Just Saying All This to Make a Sale?”
Next, use a “If ___, then ___” to reaffirm their objection as the reason they’re still reading, listening, or watching instead of buying. The closer this objection matches their internal dialogue, the better. 
Next, bluntly tell them that it makes no difference to you whether they buy or not. Give them several “It won’t…” or “I won’t…” statements that describe how your life will go on whether they buy or not. 
Next, flip the script by telling them that it will have a dramatic impact on their life, not only today, but long after today. Give them several “It will…” statements that describe the physical, financial, social, and emotional impact your PROMISE will have on them.
These benefits should go beyond the scope of your product or service, to address larger changes in your prospect’s lifestyle. The better you do at expanding the scope of these benefits, the more compelling this message will be. See my three copywriting articles below for details on this technique. 
www.sethczerepak.com/emotional-copywriting
www.sethczerepak.com/positioning-in-copywriting
www.sethczerepak.com/urgency-in-copywriting
Once you’ve laid out these benefits, use an “I’ve offered…” statement to remind them of your GUARANTEE. 
Next, use an “I’ve given…” or “I’ve shown…” or “I’ve demonstrated…” statement to briefly remind them of the key elements of your Positioning message (superiority, relevance, uniqueness).  
Most importantly, remind them of the success stories you’ve shared and tie this off by telling them that the people in these stories will continue enjoying their success whether your prospect buys today or not. This refocus on self-interest and the reminder that they’re being left out will snap them out of their fear, and make them eager to buy. 
********************************EXAMPLE********************************
If You Really Want to Help, Why Not Give This Away?
Right now, you might be thinking, "Seth, if you're making so much money, why are you selling this for $1997?" 
The truth is, it makes no difference to me whether you buy this program or not.
It will have zero impact on my life or even my day. It won’t change what I wear, what I drive, or what I have for dinner tonight. I won’t even check to see whether you bought it. It’s nothing to me whether you invest $1997 in yourself today or not. 
It will, however, have a dramatic impact on your whole life, for the rest of your life. 
It will dramatically impact how much money you can spend on your physical health. 
It will dramatically impact how much money you can invest into your family’s financial future. 
It will dramatically impact how much respect people give you when they see you achieving things they’ve only dreamed about. 
I’ve offered to refund 100% of your money and pay you $500 for your time if you’re not absolutely convinced after using this program for 90 days.
I’ve given you plenty of good reasons to give this program a try, and I’ve shared dozens of success stories from people who will continue enjoying their success whether you join today or not. 
The only question now is whether you’ll benefit from the decision you’re about to make. 
***********************************END************************************




 
Post CTA 
Post CTA Prompt:
Now use the variables and subvariables to write our Post CTA message. This Post CTA message MUST be consistent with what’s in the copy we’ve already created for this funnel. Please use the content in the article below as a guide in creating my Post CTA message. 
www.sethczerepak.com/urgency-in-copywriting
This Post CTA message should focus on internal pressure rather than external pressure. Internal pressure is based on what psychologists call “cognitive dissonance.” Cognitive dissonance is that uncomfortable feeling you get when you hold contradictory beliefs, ideas, feelings, or values. Cognitive dissonance theory states that people may change their attitude or their behavior to relieve themselves from this psychological discomfort. Your job is to create cognitive dissonance in your prospect using a Post CTA message that contrasts the emotional pain of your prospect’s PROBLEM with the emotional benefit of your PROMISE. 
Start your Post CTA message with a double tie down style subheader like one of these:
1.	Isn’t It Time to Stop [PROBLEM], and Start [PROMISE]?
2.	Isn’t It Time to Start [PROMISE], and Stop [PROBLEM]?
3.	Haven’t You Waited Long Enough for [PROMISE]?
4.	Haven’t You Suffered from [PROBLEM] Long Enough?
Next, use a statement like “You want [PROMISE]…” or “You’ve read this far because you want [PROMISE].” Then, use a statement like “By now, you know that there are only two choices left…” followed by a summary of their two choices: 
1.	The PROBLEM and its pain points
2.	Your PROMISE and its benefits
Next, take a shot at the negatives of doing nothing (MYTHS, MISTAKES, or ALTERNATIVES [whichever you covered earlier in your funnel]), with a statement like “Forget all the…” or “No more wasting time with…” followed by a list of the negative things they’re struggling with now. 
Next, confirm that none of these things matter if they don’t have the advantage that your product or service USP gives them. Take three shots at these MYTHS, MISTAKES, or ALTERNATIVES by highlighting their ongoing negative impact. 
Next, remind them of the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional cost they’ve already suffered as a result of the above things. Add a statement like “you’re running out of (time, money, opportunity, etc.)…” statement to remind them of how relevant, critical, and urgent the PROBLEM is and the CRISIS it will inevitably lead to. 
Next, use a question to confirm whether they still want to solve the PROBLEM and experience the PROMISE, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. Here are some examples of this kind of question:
●	Want to get unstuck and explode your income? 
●	Isn’t it time to rid yourself of pain and stiffness for good?
●	Ready to finally experience the loving marriage you deserve?
Next, give your prospect a direct command or suggestion to take ACTION, and tie this to the PROMISE and the DEADLINE. Follow this with another reminder of the high cost (in time, money, energy, health, emotional pain, etc.) of doing nothing, continuing what they’re doing now, and/or experimenting with the ALTERNATIVES or trying to get the result themselves. 
Next, use a statement like “One you [ACTION]…” or “As soon as you [ACTION]…” or “The moment you [ACTION]…” followed by a future pacing of them owning and/or using your product or service, and experiencing the PROMISE within the DEADLINE. 
Next, use a “Other [SOLUTION], will claim [competitor’s claims here], but how many will [your GUARANTEE here]?” Answer this question with a clear and bold claim that your competitor simply can’t offer the same USP, PROMISE, and/or GUARANTEE. 
Next, plant a splinter in their mind with a statement like “Now that you know this…you’ll…” or “Now that you’ve read this…you’ll…” or “Now that you know how to [PROMISE]…you’ll…” followed by a embedded hypnotic suggestion about your OFFER and/or message sticking in their memory. 
Add a statement like “You’ll think about this every time you…” followed by a word picture of their experience with the PROBLEM or their frustrations with the SOLUTION. Finish with a statement like “It’s time to stop [PROBLEM] and [PROMISE] so you can [physical, financial, social and/or emotional benefit].”

Isn’t It Time To Break Your Income Plateau?
You want to scale from six to seven figures. By now, you know that there are only two choices left: 
1.	Keep burning yourself out hoping to “go viral.” 
2.	Learn to convert cold traffic into leads, sales, and revenue. 
Forget all the boring theories about delegation, systemization, and building “scalable business processes.” None of that matters until you can attract a flood of brand new, ready-to-buy inbound traffic. 
Your warm network will only get you so far. It takes time, energy, and attention to build it. 
Cold calling and cold emailing have their limits. 
Same with writing SEO content and every other non-scalable lead generation method. 
You’ve burned yourself out doing it the hard way. You’re running out of warm contacts, and you can only invest so much time into finding new ones. 
Want to get unstuck and explode your income? 
It’s simple. Join this program, and learn to convert cold traffic into leads, sales, and repeat revenue. Your business will never grow to seven figures without it. You’ll burn yourself out trying. 
Once you crack the cold traffic code, you can happily invest money into buying traffic because you KNOW it will bring you more customers, more revenue, and the kind of life most entrepreneurs only get to dream about. It’s that simple. 
But it’s not easy. 
That’s why so few marketing “experts” dare to talk about this subject. They don’t know how to make it work. 
Now that you know this, you’ll remember it every time you’re struggling to find new business. 
It’s time to break past your income plateau so you can create the explosive growth you’ve been dreaming about. 
***********************************END************************************
Notice how this example contrasts your prospect’s present burnout with the growth they’re hoping for. This contrast is connected to my reader’s need for excitement and its polar negative, boredom (we’ll cover this topic in more detail in Chapter XI). These contrasting emotions will drive them to move away from the pain of the present, and toward the hopeful picture I’ve created in my copy. 
You’ll also notice that I planted a “splinter in their mind,” with this statement:
“Now that you know this, you’ll remember it every time you’re struggling to find new business.”
This assures that my message will stick in their mind, even if they don’t buy right away. If you have a robust follow-up strategy using email, SMS, or retargeting, this is a powerful way to make sure you can re-engage our AUDIENCE.
Power PS Prompt:
Now write our Power PS message. This Power PS message MUST be consistent with what’s in the copy we’ve already created for this funnel. I’ve included a few variations in the ten examples below, and a final example that includes three Power PS statements, followed by your final CTA. Please create one PS for each of the examples, using the formulas behind the examples below to create each message.

Call Booking 
VSL MAIN Prompt
This video outlines a step-by-step process to create high-converting VSLs (Video Sales Letters) using psychological hooks, storytelling, NLP techniques, and sales psychology. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the framework and techniques he shares:
 
General Framework: The 9 Essential Steps
1.	Lead
○	The opening “blind” statement that hooks the audience by hitting on their pain points immediately.
○	Written as if you’re speaking to a single person, creating intimacy.
○	Key feature: The video itself is positioned as the benefit, making them want to stay and discover more.
○	Often includes open loops (unresolved statements) to create curiosity.
○	Example: “This simple video could help you lose 30 pounds without starving yourself.”
 
2.	Story
○	The emotional, relatable background story that demonstrates how either you or a client overcame a significant problem.
○	Nightmare/hero stories are ideal, often reflecting the audience’s internal struggles (low points, failures, frustrations).
○	Must be personal and specific to be believable.
○	Pro Tip: If not using a personal story, leverage a customer’s testimonial story instead.
 
3.	Problem
○	Identify the core problem your product solves, using a negative hook to simplify it into one memorable issue.
○	Keep it digestible and relatable. Instead of listing many issues, use one “big idea” problem that anchors everything.
○	Example from BioTrust: The “leptin resistance” hook simplified the weight loss problem, turning it into a memorable selling point.
○	Pro Tip: Over-exaggerate the pain of the problem to amplify emotional engagement.
 
4.	Solution
○	Introduce your positive hook or unique mechanism as the key to solving the problem.
○	Often teased earlier (during the lead) to keep curiosity flowing.
○	Create an open loop, which won’t be fully resolved until after presenting the solution.
○	Example: “Introducing a groundbreaking nanoparticle technology that transforms magnesium absorption.”
 
5.	Offer
○	The first point in the VSL where you formally introduce what you’re selling.
○	Educational, NOT “salesy.”
○	Keep them engaged by carefully transitioning from the problem to the product as a natural solution.
○	Two or three-stage process: Gradually introduce the product details, starting with benefits, followed by the name, features, and then price.
○	Keep focusing on the one main idea throughout.
 
6.	Testimonials
○	Social proof provided by previous buyers or users.
○	VSL-specific testimonials: Viewers sharing how just watching the video alone helped them (to hook new viewers).
○	Power tip: Convert traditional testimonials into reader-focused benefits: “Imagine yourself waking up refreshed, just like Peter did.”
 
7.	Price
○	Introduce the price using a value drop-down strategy:
■	Anchor a higher price (e.g., $200 or $1,000) to create contrast.
■	Justify the price using comparisons to costly alternatives (e.g., consultants, doctors, or treatments).
■	Reveal the final “bargain” price as a surprise.
○	NLP techniques, such as presuppositions (“after you click this button…”), are embedded to lead the prospect into action.
 
8.	Guarantee
○	A results-based or money-back guarantee that instills confidence.
○	Important: Frame the guarantee as a positive promise, not as a safety net for failure.
■	Bad example: “If it doesn’t work, you get your money back.”
■	Better example: “You’ll see improved focus, better sleep, and reduced anxiety—or you don’t pay.”
 
9.	Close
○	The final call to action, typically employing a Crossroads Close where the audience is presented with two choices:
■	Continue living with their problem.
■	Or take action and change their life.
○	Employs phrases like: “We both know how rare it is for these problems to go away on their own.”
 
Key VSL Techniques and Insights
●	Simple Production: VSLs don’t require flashy visuals. Text on slides paired with a voiceover is enough to engage viewers.
●	Hypnotic Slide Progression: Slides act like mini-headlines, driving attention and creating an immersive, hypnotic experience.
●	Multiple Modalities: Combines audio and video (reading + listening), increasing retention and action-taking by engaging multiple senses.
●	NLP Techniques:
○	Open loops to build anticipation and tension.
○	Presuppositions: Implicit suggestions embedded into sentences (e.g., “after you click”).
○	Pattern interrupts: Disrupting expected flow to regain attention and reset focus.
○	Anaphora: Repetition of the same phrase (e.g., “Forget about…” or “It’s time to…”) to drive emotional intensity.
 
AI-Assisted VSL Creation
●	John Benson’s AI Tool (Vinon/Benson AI) automates the VSL creation process:
○	It generates leads, stories, problem statements, and offers based on blueprint data, saving time.
○	Built-in NLP, testimonial transformation, and lead generation frameworks help create VSLs in minutes.
 
Summary of the Framework’s Success Formula
●	Emotion + Logic: Start with emotionally charged pain points, guide them through logical solutions, and close with emotional triggers.
●	Simplicity + Repetition: Maintain simplicity with one major problem, one solution, and repetitive reinforcement of benefits.
●	Psychology-Driven: Techniques like anchoring, pattern interrupts, open loops, and presuppositions drive high engagement and conversions.
This breakdown should give you everything you need to deconstruct or recreate highly effective VSLs! Would you like me to further dive into any specific technique or section?
Opening Prompt (With Detailed Examples)
Objective: Write a captivating opening for a VSL or virtual event targeting coaches, consultants, or course creators stuck in a cycle of failed “proven systems” for growth. The goal is to immediately grab attention, build curiosity, and guide the audience toward trust and engagement.
Structure Requirements:
1.	Use leading/priming statements to hook the audience, creating intrigue and urgency.
2.	Leverage groupthink/bandwagon phrases to establish credibility and highlight common frustrations.
3.	Include perception of value levers (reciprocity, loss aversion, or time/money preframes) to demonstrate the worth of paying attention.
4.	Employ creative repetition by previewing the key promise and revisiting it for clarity.
5.	Use priming, confirmation, and recap questions to reinforce the message.
6.	Maintain an engaging tone with participation prompts and intentional word emphasis through changes in tonality or volume.
7.	Integrate authentic language to build trust and connection, avoiding flashy but empty promises.
 
Instructions for Crafting the VSL Opening:
 
1.	Start with a leading/priming statement to hook their attention:
 Use phrases such as:
●	“Well, listen to this…”
●	“Here’s something really important.”
●	“Here’s the thing…”
●	“This is crucial, and here’s why…”
●	“You’re probably wondering…”
●	“Here’s the problem…”
●	“This will surprise you…”
●	“The bottom line is…”
●	“Please understand…”
●	“Here’s the secret key to remember…”
Example in action:
●	"Here’s something you don’t want to miss: the #1 reason you’ve been stuck at six figures, constantly chasing leads, is hiding in plain sight. And today, we’re going to expose it."
 
2.	Introduce their pain point using groupthink/bandwagon phrases:
 Use phrases like:
●	“Everyone knows…”
●	“We all know…”
●	“A widely known fact…”
●	“It goes without saying…”
●	“This is common knowledge, but…”
●	“The debate is over…”
●	“Research shows…”
Example in action:
●	“We all know that scaling a coaching or consulting business is supposed to be straightforward, right? Set up a funnel, run ads, and boom—leads pour in. But if you’ve tried that, you already know that’s not how it works.”
 
3.	Build perception of value using POV levers:
 Choose techniques like:
●	Reciprocity: Use phrases like “I’ll give you…”
○	“I’m going to give you a proven strategy that has worked for over 100 clients without needing constant tweaking.”
●	Loss Aversion: Frame the risk of inaction with phrases like:
○	“If you fail to act on this, you could be losing $1,000 every month.”
●	Time/Money Preframe: Highlight time or effort invested in discovering this insight:
○	“It took me five years and countless failures to discover this, so you don’t have to.”
Example in action:
●	“I’ll give you a powerful insight today—one that took me five years to perfect and hundreds of clients to test. If you don’t pay attention, you’ll miss what could be your biggest turning point.”
 
4.	Spark curiosity and engagement with strategic questions:
 Use priming, confirmation, and recap questions to involve the audience:
●	Priming Questions:

○	“What’s the #1 way to create consistent leads without relying on luck or expensive strategies?”
○	“What do you think is holding most coaches back from scaling to seven figures?”
●	Confirmation Questions:

○	“So the best way to get consistent leads is what? Solving the right problem, not chasing tactics.”
●	Recap Questions:

○	“So, what’s the key takeaway? It’s that predictable growth requires solving the bottlenecks no one talks about.”
Example in action:
●	“What’s the #1 reason most coaches plateau at six figures and burn through expensive programs without results? It’s not because they’re lazy. It’s because they’re focusing on the wrong problem.”
 
5.	Creative repetition of the key promise:
●	Use the 3-step clarity formula:
○	“Tell them what you’re going to say.”
○	“Tell them.”
○	“Tell them what you told them.”
Example in action:
●	“I’m going to show you exactly why most growth strategies fail, how to avoid the trap of over-automation, and how to build a predictable system that fits your audience. By the end, you’ll have the missing piece to sustainable growth.”
 
6.	Encourage participation to create engagement:
 Use phrases like:
●	“Say ‘Yes’ if you’ve felt this frustration before.”
●	“Raise your hand if you’ve ever spent thousands on ads that didn’t convert.”
●	“Drop a ‘GOLD’ in the chat if this resonates.”
Example in action:
●	“Drop a ‘Yes’ in the chat if you’ve ever bought a course promising ‘unlimited leads’ only to be ghosted by prospects.”
 
7.	Use tonality and volume changes for emphasis:
●	Emphasize key phrases by punctuating, pausing, or singing them.
●	Examples:
○	“The problem is... they don’t tell you this.”
○	“The truth is, you’ve been sold the wrong blueprint.”
 
8.	End with authenticity and a preview of the outcome:
 Be real, clear, and vulnerable:
●	“Let’s be real—this isn’t about flashy tactics. It’s about finally seeing what’s been missing all along.”
Example closing:
●	“By the end of this, you’ll know exactly why typical advice hasn’t worked and how to unlock sustainable growth. But more importantly, you’ll see why it’s simpler than you think.”
 
Prompt Format Recap:
Your opening should include priming statements, groupthink reinforcement, value perception, participation prompts, and strategic questions woven throughout. End the opening with clarity, repetition of the key promise, and authenticity to set the stage for the rest of the VSL or event.
Question Control (QC)
This prompt is designed to integrate priming, confirmation, continuation, and recap questions to maintain attention, build audience engagement, and guide them through key points. It helps lock attention by addressing objections before they arise, forcing the audience to stay focused and reinforcing the main ideas through strategic repetition.
 
QC VSL or Virtual Event Prompt:
Use the following guidelines to weave in question control through your VSL:
1.	Priming Questions (“Spark”): These ignite curiosity and focus by posing powerful, attention-grabbing questions at key moments.
○	Use when introducing a major point or transition.
○	Examples:
■	“What’s the hidden mental block costing entrepreneurs their next six figures?”
■	“How do you break through the invisible wall of speaking and selling confidence?”
■	“If you truly want to land more clients and bigger opportunities, what do you think is the fastest way to get there?”
 
2.	Confirmation Questions (“Lock”): These reinforce the main takeaway and solidify it in the audience’s mind.
○	Use after explaining a key concept to lock their understanding.
○	Examples:
■	“So, what’s the real reason typical ‘confidence hacks’ don’t work? They don’t address the root emotional block.”
■	“So, what do you need to do to unlock your full speaking potential? You need to dissolve the mental block.”
■	“So what’s the solution to consistent, confident selling? It’s not tactics—it’s fixing the block holding you back.”
 
3.	Continuation Questions (“Linking”): These maintain momentum and bridge transitions by linking points together.
○	Use to introduce new sections or continue the flow of ideas.
○	Examples:
■	“Now, you’re probably wondering, how do I uncover this block?”
■	“What’s next after identifying the block?”
■	“Why do I say that identifying and fixing this mental block is the game-changer?”
 
4.	Recap and Fill-In-The-Blank Questions: These reinforce understanding through audience participation and repetition.
○	Use before summarizing or wrapping up sections.
○	Examples:
■	“So, the #1 way to gain confidence on sales calls and stages is ______? Fixing the mental block.”
■	“So, the question becomes, what’s the fastest way to unlock that confidence and keep it for life?”
■	“Let’s recap—what’s the one thing keeping you from booking high-ticket clients consistently?”
 
Why Question Control Works
●	“TikTok Brains”: Keeps audiences engaged by constantly shifting their focus through questions.
●	Avoids Audience Drift: Reduces their tendency to get distracted or question your authority.
●	Mental Anchoring: By making them answer simple questions, they mentally reinforce your key points.
 
When to Use Question Control in the VSL:
●	Lead Section: Spark their curiosity with a priming question (e.g., “What’s the one hidden block costing you millions?”)
●	Story Section: Use confirmation questions to lock in empathy (“So, what’s the key takeaway from my story?”)
●	Problem Section: Use continuation questions to transition to the solution (“How do you solve a problem you don’t even know you have?”)
●	Solution Section: Prime curiosity about how it works (“So, you’re probably wondering, how does this method actually unlock confidence?”)
●	Close Section: Recap their key takeaways (“So, what’s the one step you need to take today?”)
 
Mistakes to Avoid:
●	Overloading with questions, making it feel like an interrogation.
●	Using questions that don’t directly lead to your core message.
●	Asking questions that could lead to “yes” or “no” answers without elaboration.
 
Exercise:
Practice using the QC method by creating a mini framework for your own VSL section:
1.	Write a basic statement about a core problem or solution.
 Example: “A lack of speaking confidence is blocking your growth.”

2.	Add a priming question:
 “What’s the hidden mental block keeping high-ticket clients just out of reach?”

3.	Add a confirmation question:
 “So, what’s the key to overcoming this block? Addressing the mental and emotional barrier directly.”

4.	Add a continuation question:
 “So, how do you uncover and eliminate it?”

5.	End with a fill-in-the-blank or recap question:
 “The fastest way to turn speaking anxiety into confidence is ______? Fixing the block at its root.”



 
Upsell Chain (Working) 
 
OTO 
Upsell Formulas 
In case you’re unfamiliar, an upsell is an offer you make to your new customer immediately after they’ve finished checking out. You should also make offers on the checkout page, or just before they checkout. Offers made before the checkout page are called cross sells, and offers made on the checkout page are called order bumps. These extra offers serve three purposes.  
1.	To liquidate your ad spend 
2.	To liquidate your ad spend 
3.	To liquidate your ad spend 
If you happen to make a little profit selling these extra items, that’s great. But consider this profit a bonus, and don’t expect it. Remember what I said in Chapter II. The purpose of your first sale is to earn a customer. If you try to make it about profit, your mind will fool you into thinking that a campaign “isn’t working” because it’s not making immediate profits. This is a limiting belief that will block you from scaling to seven figures and beyond. In my experience, a good upsell page contains these elements:
1.	Opening
2.	Positioning
3.	Offer Stack
4.	Call to Action
5.	Post CTA
6.	Power PS
Cross sells and order bumps are best if offered as bundled items or accessories to your primary OFFER. You should make two to three cross sell offers, and 1-3 order bumps. Start with one order bump, and add one at a time until you get to three. You can expect these pre-checkout offers to convert at 10% to 50%. If they convert higher than that, great. But don’t rest your hopes on these items alone. Your post-checkout upsell is your best hope for liquidating ad spend. According to the law of averages (which we’ll discuss in Chapter XII), 10% to 20% of your buyers should take your upsell offer, and you should sell it for 4-5x the price of your original OFFER. In most cases, this means your upsell offer will sell for $200  to $500. 
The idea is that once your buyer has spent money, their brain will release the reward chemical dopamine. Dopamine is a feel-good neurotransmitter that tells your brain and nervous system that you just did something awesome. It creates a feeling that makes you much, much, more likely to buy more stuff. This is why you sometimes go to the grocery store for a gallon of milk, a carton of eggs, or a box of cereal and you walk out with $100+ word of groceries. 
These stores spend a lot of money figuring out how to place their products, and promotions so that you keep buying, and keep flooding your brain with dopamine. It’s the same thing when you make an upsell offer, and this is how you can get away with charging four or five times the price. Your original offer puts your new customer into buying mode, and your upsell gets them to spend more money.  Now that I’ve got you on a dopamine high about upsell offers, here’s the bad news.
Upsell Objections
Customers won’t buy just any upsell offer. They’ll come to your upsell offer page with one or more of the following objections:  
●	“I just bought something that does this!” 
●	“This has nothing to do with my problem!”
●	“I’m going to try out what I bought first.”
It doesn’t matter whether you agree with your customer about these objections or not. If your upsell offer doesn’t answer them, they won’t buy it. You have to rebuttal these three objections with an upsell message that shows your new customer one or more of the following:
●	That your upsell enhances your primary OFFER. 
●	That your upsell solves a next level PROBLEM. 
●	That your upsell delivers a next level PROMISE. 
I’ve listed these in order of difficulty, with the next level PROMISE being the most difficult to pull off, but also the most rewarding. I don’t recommend that you sell a product or service that will put your new customer back in Stage #1 or #2. In other words, don’t sell a product or service that solves a PROBLEM they’re unaware of or a SOLUTION type they’re not already sold on. Your upsell offer should be a product or service you can sell using a Trip-Wire sales page. If you have to use a VSL, or a webinar to promote your upsell, you need another one. Sell that offer using followup marketing, and make your upsell offer something that either solves a next level PROBLEM, delivers a next level PROMISE, enhances your primary OFFER, or all of the above. 
The good news is, you don’t need a brand new message formula to create the sales copy for your upsell page. You can use the sales page formulas we discussed in Chapter VI, with one small (and damn important) difference…your opening. 
Upsell Openings 
Nothing is more essential to making you rich than the opening sales copy to your upsell offer. Damn, I just made that sound really serious, didn’t I? But it’s the truth. If your upsell opening is good, 10% or more of your new customers will take your upsell. This is usually enough to liquidate almost all your ad spend, or even give you a little profit on the front end. This is how you get the financial leverage, and the courage, to scale your ad spend until your business is pouring raking in $100k or more a month. I’ve seen it happen many, many times, and a solid upsell offer is usually the one thing that closes the gap and makes this possible. Keep that in mind as we unpack these three formulas.  
Formula #1: Enhance Your Offer
Your upsell can enhance your main OFFER in one of more of these three ways: 
1.	By delivering the original PROMISE faster
2.	By delivering the original PROMISE on a bigger scale
3.	By enhancing your “Super Seven” appeal of your OFFER
I’ll demonstrate the first two approaches below. We’ll discuss the third in Chapter XI when we unpack my Super Seven. 
Start this message with one of the following headlines or openings statements: 
1.	“What if you could…” or “How would you like to…” or “Want to…” followed by a question about solving the PROBLEM, and/or achieving the PROMISE sooner than the DEADLINE and/or on a larger scale than you had promised with your original OFFER. 
2.	Tell them that this message is only for people who want to  solve the PROBLEM and/or achieve the PROMISE sooner than the DEADLINE and/or on a larger scale than you promised in your original OFFER. 
3.	Tell them that they can skip this message if they don’t want to solve the PROBLEM and/or achieve the PROMISE sooner than the DEADLINE and/or on a larger scale than you promised in your original OFFER. 
Next, reaffirm the PROMISE you made with your original OFFER. Then, use an “If ___, here’s why___” qualifying statement to tie one of the qualifiers below to the ACTION you’ll be asking them to take on your upsell page:
1.	They don’t want to settle for the speed or magnitude of the original PROMISE. 
2.	They want to go beyond the original PROMISE and get a better (see my Super Seven from Chapter XI) result. 
Next, tell them how the upsell product or service can solve the PROBLEM and/or achieve the PROMISE sooner than the DEADLINE and/or on a larger scale than you promised in your original OFFER by revealing the USP of your upsell offer. 
Use a subheader here to tell them that this upsell offer expires either by a deadline, or after a limited supply of the product or service has been sold. 
Next, tell them that this is why you’re inviting them to solve the PROBLEM and/or achieve the PROMISE sooner than the DEADLINE and/or on a larger scale than you promised in your original OFFER. Tell them that this is a limited time/supply offer that they need to act on before it expires. 
Use an “Imagine…” or “What Would Do You if…” or “How Would Your ___ Change if…” subheader here to set up the future pacing section below. 
Future pace by telling them that when your upsell promise deadline comes, they’ll be enjoying the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional benefits of the upsell promise. For extra effect, tie this off by introducing  your upsell guarantee and risk removals. 
Finish with an “If___, then___” statement to tie all of this to the qualifying statement you made earlier in the opening, and transition to either the Offer Positioning section of your upsell page.

Formula #2: Next Level Problem
A next level problem is a problem your customer will encounter because of the result promised in your main OFFER. Here are a few examples:
●	Your original offer helps them heal from a bad relationship, but now they need to set boundaries with toxic people. 
●	Your original offer floods their business with new leads, but now they need a lead followup and booking system.  
●	Your original offer gets them out of debt, but now they need a clear plan for budgeting their money and building wealth.
My only warning here is that the next level problem should be something your prospect can easily see and understand. If the connection between your original PROMISE and the next level problem is obvious, your upsell will be a no-brainer. Otherwise, your prospect will ignore it. 
Start this message with a blunt headline about a problem they’ve just created by purchasing your OFFER. Next, use your opening lines to make the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional cost of this offer explicit, while cloaking the problem itself in vague or mysterious language. See my article on breadcrumbing below for details on how to do this. 
https://sethczerepak.com/suspense-in-copywriting/ 
Next, reaffirm the PROMISE you made with your original OFFER. Then, a “But this also means…”  followed by a reveal of the next level problem, and how it will either:
1.	Negate all (or most) of the BENEFITS of your original PROMISE. 
2.	Create other  problems that will leave them questioning whether the original PROMISE was worth it. 
Next, spell out the hassles they’ll run into trying to solve this next level problem on their own. Include any and all physical, social, financial, and/or costs of trying to do this without your upsell offer. 
Next, use a statement like “That’s why…” or “The good news is…” to explain why you’re inviting them to solve the next level problem, and even magnify the BENEFITS of the original PROMISE. Tell them how the upsell product or service solves the next level problem by revealing the USP of your upsell offer. 
Next, future pace by telling them that instead of suffering the hassles of this problem and/or the costs of trying to solve it on their own, they’ll be enjoying the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional benefits of the upsell promise. For extra effect, tie this off by introducing  your upsell guarantee and risk removals. 
Finish with an “If___, then___” statement to tie all of this to the qualifying statement from earlier in your opening, and to transition to the Offer Positioning section of your upsell message.

SORRY, We’ve Just Created This New Problem for Your Marriage… 
If you think your fights are bad now, wait until you start showing up as the husband your wife really wants. That’s right…showing up as the man she needs is just the first step.  
You now have all the tools for becoming the kind of husband she’s always dreamed about in just 30 days. But if she really loves you, she’ll test your sincerity. She’ll throw everything she has at you to see if this change is for real.
If you lose your cool, or slip back into your old habits, even for a SECOND, things will be worse than they were before you bought this course. 
Are You Ready for Her Sincerity Tests?
You’re gonna need a whole new set of skills for becoming a great communicator, and learning to turn conflicts into opportunities to bond with her, and strengthen your marriage. 
Sure, you can learn that on your own. You can watch some YouTube videos, experiment with some techniques, pick up a few books on communication, and conflict resolution. 
You’ll probably make a lot of mistakes while trying to figure this out. You might even make things worse, and lose her trust and respect for good. 
The good news is, you don’t have to risk your marriage trying to trial and error your way through the next step. You can become a master at navigating conflict, and even using it to strengthen your marriage, and it can happen in the next 30 days. 
Imagine Turning Arguments Into Bonding Opportunities
I’ve collected the absolute best communication, and conflict management techniques, and strategies that I’ve used to bring hundreds of marriages back from the dead. I’ve packaged them all into a Conflict Mastery Course that will sharpen, and refine your communication and conflict management skills so fast, you’ll become more than an irresistibly loved husband. 
Even the people you work with will comment on your next level skills of persuasion, influence, and authentic leadership. 
In fact, if three people you know don’t compliment the drastic upgrade in your communication and listening skills over the next 30 days, I’ll GIVE you six months of my one on one counseling sessions, at zero charge. 
So if you’re ready to become the husband she’s always dreamed about, AND show up as a confident, compassionate, and effective leader, at home and at work, here’s how it’s going to happen. 
***********************************END************************************
Formula #3: Next Level Promise
A next level promise is a promise that your new customer can achieve on top of your original PROMISE. Here are a few examples of a next level promise:
●	Your original offer helps them heal from a bad relationship, and next you’ll help them find their soulmate within a year. 
●	Your original offer floods their business with new leads, and next you’ll help them sell more to their existing customers.  
●	Your original offer gets them out of debt, and now you’ll show them how to make passive income and leave their job.
The caveat is that the next level promise should be something your prospect can easily see and understand. If the connection between your original PROMISE and your next level promise is obvious, your upsell will be much more persuasive. If not, your prospect will ignore your upsell, or tell themselves that they’ll try it later if they like your original OFFER. 
Start this message with a headline that links your original PROMISE to your next level promise. For extra effect, add the deadline of your next level promise, and the EXTERNAL OBJECTION. I’ve done both of these in the example below. 
Next, reaffirm the PROMISE you made with your original OFFER. Then, use a statement like “Now imagine…” followed by a description of the next level promise and its physical, financial, social, and/or emotional benefits. 
OPTIONAL: tell them that they can experience the above mentioned benefits without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and/or despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Next, spell out the hassles they’ll run into trying to achieve this next level PROMISE on their own. Include any and all physical, social, financial, and/or costs of trying to do this without your upsell offer. 
Next, use a statement like “That’s why…” or “The good news is…” to explain why you’re inviting them to achieve the next level promise, and even magnify the BENEFITS of the original PROMISE. 
Tell them how the upsell product or service helps them achieve the next level promise without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION by revealing the USP of your upsell offer. 
Next, future pace by telling them that instead of dealing with the costs of trying to achieve this upsell promise on their own, they’ll be enjoying the physical, financial, social, and/or emotional benefits of the upsell promise. For extra effect, tie this off by introducing  your upsell guarantee and risk removals. 
Finish with an “If___, then___” statement to tie all of this to the qualifying statement from earlier in your opening, and to transition to the Offer Positioning section of your upsell message.

Want to Double Your $10k AND Make $500 (or More) a Week on 100% Autopilot? 
Congratulations! You now have the fastest, most powerful strategy for doubling your $10k investment in the next 30 days. 
Now, imagine waking up every morning to find several cash deposits in your bank account. 
Imagine having an extra $500 (or more) of spending money every month, without doing a single minute of work. 
But that’s not all…
If you do what I’m about to show you, you could reinvest that $500 and grow it to $1,000 or even $5,000 every month. With NO additional work required. 
Yes, There’s a Catch…
What I’ve just described is passive income…and it’s the secret to getting rich and enjoying financial independence. But there are HUNDREDS of wrong ways to go about it. 
The internet is riddled with scammy, nonsensical ways to make passive income. Most of them will never work, even after you’ve dumped tens of thousands of dollars into them, and burned up hundreds of hours of your precious time. 
That’s why I’ve collected the three easiest, time-tested, recession proof methods for earning passive income, even if you’ve never made money in your sleep, and don’t care to start a side hustle. 
These methods are so easy, and so cost effective, you can set them up in the next 14 days, and start making at least $500 a month by this time next month. I know these methods work, because I’m still using ALL of them, and I’m inviting you to watch me every month, as I teach you how to get them working, and KEEP them working…month after month, year after year. 
I reveal everything in my passive income mastery group, which I’m inviting you to join 100% FREE for the next 30 days. If you use what I teach you, you’ll make more than enough money to cover the monthly membership, which I’m offering to you at a deep discount below. 
WARNING: This offer WILL expire when you close this page, so please read this next part carefully. 
Here’s How it Works…
Imagine the look on your spouse’s face when they find out you’ve doubled your $10k AND cracked the code to making money while you’re not working. 
What would you do with an extra $500 to $1,000 a month? 
Pay off your house or your cars faster? 
Use it to wipe out your credit card debt, without touching your other sources of income? 
Would you reinvest it and turn your $500 into $1,000 or even $5,000? 
Now you can. I’m so confident of this, that if you join this group and don’t get the result I just promised, I’ll pay you $100 just for trying it out. All I ask is that you give it an honest RISK FREE try for the next 30 days. 
If you're getting excited just thinking about this, and you're ready to double your $10k AND build a 100% hands-free income stream in the next 30 days, here's how this program will make it happen. 
***********************************END************************************
You now have all the formulas you need for writing your upsell message. You can use these formulas to create an upsell page, or VSL, depending on the complexity of your upsell offer. The rest of your upsell message will contain elements already covered in previous chapters.
Upsell Page Elements
1.	Opening
2.	Offer Stack
3.	Call to Action
4.	Positioning
5.	Call to Action
6.	Post CTA
7.	Power PS
You’ll notice the Positioning message comes after your Offer Stack this time. In your webinar, VSL, and your Trip-Wire page it came before the Offer Stack. If your upsell opening has sold your new customer on the enhanced promise, the next level problem, or the next level promise, your Offer Stack should close the deal. If not, your Positioning Pitch should overcome any lingering objections. If it doesn’t, there’s a good chance your upsell is either no good, or that your opening message missed the mark. This is where heat mapping data will be your best friend, which we’ll discuss in Chapter XII when we talk about troubleshooting your funnel. 
Before we move on to your upsell followup sequence, let me introduce two more upsell strategies: 
1.	Sell them more of what they just bought. 
2.	Sell them a complete set of products, with your original OFFER as part of the set. 
The first strategy is strictly for consumable products. Some examples include, supplements, personal care products (soap, makeup, hair products, etc), food, and other consumables. The second strategy is most effective for selling products that are either more appealing, or more functional as part of a set. For example, if your customer just bought a coffee mug, you might sell them matching dishes, silverware, or a matching coffee pot. If your customer just bought beard oil, you might offer them a complete beard care kit. When done right, these two strategies require much less copy, and can be offered before or on your checkout page. You can enhance these offers with bundle discounts, or by promoting items in the complete set as free bonuses. 
Upsell Sequence
An Upsell Sequence pushes a new customer who didn’t buy your upsell to buy it. In my experience, the most effective Upsell Sequences include these messages: 
1.	Remind
2.	Resell
3.	Urgency
4.	External Objections
5.	Internal Objections
6.	Commitment Objections
7.	Character Objections
8.	Downsell
You’ll notice that these are similar to the Offer Stack messages we used in your Trust-Building sequence. Since only the first two messages are different, we’ll only cover those here. My only warning is that this sequence shouldn’t interfere with your Booking sequence. I’ll explain why when we discuss your Booking Formulas and followup Sequences in the next two sections.    
Message #1: Remind
Start this message by acknowledging that they bought the main offer, but didn’t take your upsell. Follow this with a reminder of the limited time/supply of your upsell offer, as in the example below. 
Tell them that your product or service is the best (see my “Super Seven” in Chapter XI) way for them to achieve the BENEFIT by a specific deadline, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION. Seal this claim with your guarantee and RISK REMOVAL offer.  
Next, use a “Here's what you'll get when you [ACTION]...” statement to introduce your OFFER stack using the following bullet points (don’t worry about the order): 
●	Tell them how your product or service is relevant (personalized or customized) to someone like them. 
●	Tell them (or show them with social proof) how your product or service is superior to others in its category.
●	Tell them how your product or service is unique and one-of-a-kind amongst others in its category. 
●	Tell them how your product or service delivers the PROMISE without their EXTERNAL OBJECTION. 
●	Tell them how your product or service delivers the PROMISE despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
●	Remind them of what you’ll do to back up the PROMISE your OFFER makes (Risk Removal).
NOTE: Drop an early call to action for people who want to skip the message and watch the video right away (see example below).
Finish this section by telling your reader who your OFFER is for. Restate your PROMISE to deliver a BENEFIT by a specific deadline, without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION, and despite their INTERNAL OBJECTION. Use a “that’s why…” or “I’m so confident of this that…” followed by a reminder of your risk removal. 
Tie this off with a “that’s why…” or “I’m so confident of this that…” statement, followed by a summary of your PROMISE, your GUARANTEE and your RISK REMOVAL offers.  
Write a call to action that tells your reader three things:
1.	Exactly what to do.
2.	Why they need to do it.  
3.	Why they need to do it right now. 
Finish your message with a "PS:" statement that offers a premium or bonus for taking action right now. Add some urgency to this premium or bonus like a limited time or limited supply to ensure that they take action and get it now before it's gone forever. 
OPTIONAL: Give the calls to action in this message short qualifiers that clarify who your product or service is for and/or who it is not for. This is especially effective for high-ticket services that involve one on one coaching, or mentorship.

Remember that you’ll finish this Upsell Sequence with these messages (covered in the Trust-Building sequence): 
1.	Urgency
2.	External Objections
3.	Internal Objections
4.	Commitment Objections
5.	Character Objections
6.	Downsell
You now have everything you need to write an Upsell Sequence. I’ve included an invitation at the end of this chapter to discounted customization call that will show you how to get help creating your own Upsell Sequences. Remember that the remaining messages in this series will use the Offer Stack message formulas we used for your Trust-Building sequence. Next, we’ll take a look at some copywriting formulas for the most important step in your marketing funnel. 
Call Booking Formulas
Call booking formulas are for getting your prospect, or new customer, to schedule a call with a member of your sales staff. The purpose of this call will be to sell them a high-ticket product or service. By “high-ticket,” I mean anything above a thousand dollars, and ranging up to five and six figures. 
Sure, you can use a webinar or VSL to sell a high-ticket product or service. But once you get beyond the $2,000 mark, it becomes exponentially harder to sell without some human interaction. We’ll talk about where your call booking offer fits into your webinar, VSL, or Trip-Wire funnel in a moment. First, let’s look at the most effective ways to sell a call booking: 
1.	Mandatory (to their their purchase)
2.	To solve a next level problem 
3.	To achieve a next level promise
Mandatory means they must book a call to get the product or service they just bought from you. The other two should be familiar, since we covered them in the previous section on Upsell Formulas. 

 
Booking 
Call Booking Prompts:
Now write a video script for a Call Booking Offer that I’ll make to my new customers who have just purchased the OFFER above (not the Upsell Offer). Before writing this, ask me to provide the details of my Call Booking Offer. 
If I ask you for ideas, please ask me whether I want to make my Call Booking Mandatory to get the deliverables of my offer, or if I want to make an offer that solves a Next Level Problem, or makes Next Level Promise. We will call these Call Booking Formulas. Use my response to come up with three Call Booking Offer ideas for each formula that I choose. If I say that I don’t know or ask you to give me ideas for all three, give me three ideas for each Formula (Enhance my primary OFFER, Next Level Problem, or Next Level Promise). 
Ask me to either select one of the three offer ideas you’ve given me, or one Call Booking Offer idea for each of the formulas. Once you have my response, proceed by using the appropriate formula to write an upsell opening for each of the Call Booking Offer ideas I’ve selected. If I’ve selected multiple ideas, write each call booking video message one at a time, and wait for my approval on each before writing the next. 
Also, ask me if I have a call attendance bonus to offer, and ask me for either a description of what it is and what it’s worth, or a link to a document about it. If I ask you for ideas, give me five of them and let me choose one before continuing. If I don’t have one, simply skip this when creating the Call booking script. 
NOTE: Call booking formulas are for getting your prospect, or new customer, to schedule a call with a member of your sales staff. The purpose of this call will be to sell them a high-ticket product or service. By “high-ticket,” I mean anything above a thousand dollars, and ranging up to five and six figures. Here are three Call Booking Offer formulas: 
1.	Mandatory (to their their purchase)
2.	To solve a next level problem 
3.	To achieve a next level promise
Mandatory means they must book a call to get the product or service they just bought from you. The Next Level Problem means that our Call Booking Offer promises to solve a problem that our main OFFER will create because of the result it will deliver for our AUDIENCE. The Next Level Promise means that our Call Booking Offer promises to deliver a result that is even better (faster, easier, more powerful, longer lasting) than the result delivered by our main OFFER. 
Here are a couple extra tips for creating this Call booking Offer script. 
●	If it makes sense, sell the call as an opportunity for your customer to have their product customized for better results.
●	Make the call a condition of your guarantee. If your customer books the call and shows up. If not, they don’t.
●	Promote the call during your webinar, VSL, or on your sales page as a bonus of your primary OFFER. 
Ideally, we’ll want to do all of the above. But if the customization angle doesn’t work for our main OFFER, leave that part out of our message. I also suggest selling the value of the call itself, even if they decide not to accept our high-ticket offer. You’ll also notice in the next level problem formula that I dropped a hint about my high-ticket program. Use this technique for our Call Booking Offer message as well. Be sure to use the examples below to generate a headline for each of my Call Booking Offer messages, AND to affirm their order of my primary OFFER.
Formula #1: Mandatory
This formula works best if your primary OFFER is a service. For example, if you sell a logo creation service, an ad design service, or any other service that requires you to communicate with your customer, make the call booking mandatory. Do this even if you could communicate with them via email. 
Put your mandatory call booking offer after your final upsell. Make sure that even customers who reject all your upsell offers get this call booking offer. The more upsells your customer buys, the more incentive they’ll have to book the call, since they can’t get their service fulfilled without it. 
Start this message by welcoming and congratulating them. Then, tell them that they’re just one step away from the PROMISE you made with your original OFFER. 
Next, tell them to pay close attention to what you’re about to say. Tell them what can go wrong and/or what will go right if they do what you’re about to have them do. Tell them that you also have a surprise waiting for them at the end of the video, and a hint at what this surprise will do for them.  
Next, tell them that your experience in delivering this product or service taught you that one thing makes the biggest difference between people who get great results, and people who don’t. Tell them what the one thing is. If you can use a branded term here (as in the example below), all the better. 
Next, use a “That’s why…” statement to transition into a step by step description of how the call will go, and how their product or service will be delivered. 
Next use a statement like “This is how we ensure that you…” to remind them of your PROMISE, including the DEADLINE, and reminder of how it happens without the EXTERNAL OBJECTION and despite the INTERNAL OBJECTION. 
Circle back to the surprise you mentioned at the beginning of the video, including the benefit, and a hint about what it is. Tell them that they’ll find out what the surprise is on the next page. 
Finish with a call to action that tells them exactly how to book their call and that reminds them of your PROMISE.

OFFER PAGE HEADLINE: Almost Done! One More Step to BIG RESULTS in Your Coaching Business
[START VIDEO SCRIPT]
Congratulations! You now have the fastest, most powerful system for multiplying your traffic, leads, sales, and ROI in the next 90 days. 
Now, pay close attention to what I’m about to show you, because this will make all the difference in how successful you are with this system. What you do while on this page could make the difference between you making $10k next month, or $30k…even $50k. 
I’ve also got a special surprise waiting for you, and it alone could help you land your first five figure client in the next week. 
I’ve helped hundreds of business coaches succeed with this system. I’ve also seen a handful of people fail with it, and there’s one thing that makes all the difference, and that’s something I call deep customization. 
Deep customization is when you use this system to bring out the uniquely valuable features of your personal brand to set yourself head and shoulders above the thousands of ordinary coaches in your niche. 
That’s why, the first thing we’ll do is get on a call to draw out core elements of your brand, including a crisp and clear definition of your brand’s mission, and values. 
Next, my team will use this information to create a personalized content plan for making your message omnipresent on ALL your social media channels. 
Finally, we’ll set up a monthly project to turn your podcast and book content into an army of messages that will be published across all your communication channels, from your social media pages, to your followup email and SMS messages. 
By the time you’ve worked with us for a month, you’ll be well on your way to having an omnipresent message that’s clear, compelling, and consistent across all your communication channels, positioning you as a one-of-a-kind authority. 
In just 90 days from now, brand new clients will start contacting YOU, ready to pay premium prices for your services, because they’re suddenly seeing your content everywhere. 
This is how we ensure that you attract more leads to your business, convert more sales, and scale your coaching business to six and even seven figures by this time next year. 
This will happen whether you spend money on ads or not, and it doesn’t matter if you have ten followers now, or ten thousand. This is the fastest, most powerful, and 100% hands-free way to scale your online presence, your coaching business, and your lifestyle. 
It all starts with filling out the short questionnaire on this page, booking your onboarding call with my team, and discovering the surprise gift I have waiting for you on the next page.

Formula #2: Next Level Problem
This formula works best for selling high-ticket offers to customers who just bought a low-ticket offer. Put this call booking offer before your first upsell, and only make your upsell offer to people who don’t book the call. This way, your sales call is less likely to be derailed by the ole, “I’m going to try what I’ve already bought first…” objection. If your customer rejects the call booking offer, take them to the upsell. If they show up, and say a hard and definite no to your high-ticket offer, you can use your upsell offer as a “hat-in-the-hand close” on your sales call. If they book, but don’t show up, promote your upsell offer to them later via email, SMS, and/or direct mail. 
In case you’re unfamiliar, a hat-in-the-hand close is a term coined by the sales legend Zig Ziglar. Zig was a door to door salesman who would make a downsell offer at the last minute, just as he was putting his hat back on and preparing to leave the prospect’s house. Hence the term “hat-in-the-hand close.” Just be sure that your sales staff don’t use this downsell as a crutch, and only after their prospect has said a hard and definite no. 
Start this call booking message by welcoming and congratulating your customer for purchasing your OFFER. Then, use the next level problem formula I gave you in the earlier section on Upsell Openings to create the body of this video script. 
Introduce your call booking offer, and link it to the solution for the next level problem. Add some urgency by either limiting the number of surprise bonuses you’ll give out, or the number of sessions available. 
OPTIONAL: Circle back to the surprise you mentioned at the beginning of the video, remind them of its benefit, and tell them that they’ll find out what the surprise is on the next page OR on the call they’re “about to book.” 
Use a “By the end of this call…” statement to tell them that they’ll finally understand how to (or the secret t0) solve the next level problem, and why so many fail to do so. Tell them that they won’t learn this anywhere outside this call and drop a teaser about how they’ll understand why this is on the call.
Finish with a call to action that tells them exactly how to book their call, what they’ll get from showing up (benefits and/or surprise gift) and tells them that you’ll see them on the next page.

OFFER PAGE HEADLINE: SORRY, We’ve Just Created This New Problem for Your Marriage… 
[START VIDEO SCRIPT]
Welcome, and congratulations on taking the first step toward healing your marriage. Before you get started, please listen to every second of this video, because this will make all the difference in whether this program fails for you, or succeeds beyond your wildest dreams. 
Okay, some bad news first, but don’t worry…it gets good quick. 
The second you start showing up as the husband your wife really wants, you’re gonna have some fights, and I don’t want you to be caught off guard, because . That’s right…showing up as the man she needs is just the first step.  
You now have all the tools for becoming the kind of husband she’s always dreamed about in just 30 days. But if she really loves you, she’ll test your sincerity. She’ll throw everything she has at you to see if this change is for real.
If you lose your cool, or slip back into your old habits, even for a SECOND, things will be worse than they were before you bought this course. 
You’re gonna need a whole new set of skills for becoming a great communicator, and learning to turn conflicts into opportunities to bond with her, and strengthen your marriage. 
Sure, you can learn that on your own. You can watch some YouTube videos, experiment with some techniques, pick up a few books on communication, and conflict resolution. 
You’ll probably make a lot of mistakes while trying to figure this out. You might even make things worse, and lose her trust and respect for good. 
The good news is, you don’t have to risk your marriage trying to trial and error your way through the next step. You can become a master at navigating conflict, and even using it to strengthen your marriage, and it can happen in the next 30 days. 
I’ve collected the absolute best communication, and conflict management techniques, and strategies that I’ve used to bring hundreds of marriages back from the dead. I’ve packaged them all into a program customization system that will ensure you sharpen, and refine your communication and conflict management skills so fast, you’ll become more than an irresistibly loved husband. 
Even the people you work with will comment on your next level skills of persuasion, influence, and authentic leadership. In fact, if three people you know don’t compliment the drastic upgrade in your communication and listening skills over the next 30 days, I’ll GIVE you six months of my one on one counseling sessions, at zero charge. 
To get this program customization system, all it takes is a quick, 20 minute call with me or my team. This is NOT a sales call, and I promise not to waste your time. But, I also want to leave the door open for you to work with my coaching team if you decide you want faster, more certain results, that will absolutely blow your mind and amaze everyone in your life, especially your wife. 
I also want to add a special gift, “Conflict to Conversation - 10 Quick Prompts for Turning any Verbal Conflict, into a Productive Discussion…” and I’ll give you this super valuable, action guide FREE, and a set of 10 practice videos, at the end of your call.   
By the end of this call, you’ll understand the biggest secret to handling difficult conversations, and this is something you absolutely will not find ANYWHERE online or even using AI chat bots. And I’ll show you the disturbing reason for this when we talk. 
So, before you leave this page, let’s make sure you get the most out of what you just bought and claim your customization session. Hurry and book now because I only keep five of these session slots open a week, and there’s a chance all of them are booked next week. 
Fill in the form right now, book your FREE program customization session, and I’ll see you on the next page. 
***********************************END************************************
Formula #3: Next Level Promise
This formula also works best for selling high-ticket offers to customers who just bought a low-ticket offer. Put this call booking offer before your first upsell, just as you would when using the next level problem formula above. Follow the same directions for people who reject your call booking offer, those who book and don’t show up, or those who book and show up, but don’t buy your high-ticket offer. 
Start this call booking message by welcoming and congratulating your customer for purchasing your OFFER. Then, use the next level promise formula I gave you in the earlier section on Upsell Openings to create the body of this video script. 
Introduce your call booking offer, and link it to the next level promise. Add some urgency by either limiting the number of surprise bonuses you’ll give out, or the number of sessions available. 
OPTIONAL: Circle back to the surprise you mentioned at the beginning of the video, remind them of its benefit, and tell them that they’ll find out what the surprise is on the next page OR on the call they’re “about to book.” 
Use a “By the end of this call…” statement to tell them that they’ll finally understand how to (or the secret t0) achieve the next level promise, and why so many fail to do so. Tell them that they won’t learn this anywhere outside this call and drop a teaser about how they’ll understand why this is on the call.
Finish with a call to action that tells them exactly how to book their call, what they’ll get from showing up (benefits and/or surprise gift) and tells them that you’ll see them on the next page.

OFFER PAGE HEADLINE: Want to Double Your $10k AND Make $500 (or More) a Week on 100% Autopilot?  
[START VIDEO SCRIPT]
Welcome, and congratulations on taking the first step toward turning your first $10k investment into $20k. Before you get started, you need to listen to every second of this video, because this will make all the difference in whether this program fails for you, or succeeds beyond your wildest dreams. 
First, let’s imagine you waking up every morning to find several cash deposits in your bank account. 
Imagine having an extra $500 (or more) of spending money every month, without doing a single minute of work. 
Now imagine reinvesting that $500 and growing it to $1,000 or even $5,000 every month. With NO additional work required. 
Now, here’s the catch, because you’re probably thinking this sounds too good to be true.
What I’ve just described is called passive income…and it’s the secret to getting rich and enjoying financial independence. But there are HUNDREDS of wrong ways to go about it, and that’s where this next point is REALLY important, listen closely. 
As you know, the internet is riddled with scammy, nonsensical ways to make passive income. Most of them will never work, even after you’ve dumped tens of thousands of dollars into them, and burned up hundreds of hours of your precious time. 
That’s why I’ve collected the three easiest, time-tested, recession proof methods for earning passive income, even if you’ve never made money in your sleep, and don’t care to start a side hustle. 
These methods are so easy, and so cost effective, you can set them up in the next 14 days, and start making at least $500 a month by this time next month. But I want to show you this system myself, because it’s just too valuable to put it out on the internet where just anyone can find it. 
That’s why I’m inviting you to hop on a call with me, 100% FREE, so I can show you how to use this system to create your own $500 passive income stream. I will ONLY allow three of these one-on-one sessions a week, and there’s a good chance this will book out today. 
Imagine the look on your spouse’s face when they find out you’ve doubled your $10k AND cracked the code to making money while you’re not working. 
What would you do with an extra $500 to $1,000 a month? 
Pay off your house or your cars faster? 
Use it to wipe out your credit card debt, without touching your other sources of income? 
Would you reinvest it and turn your $500 into $1,000 or even $5,000? 
If you're getting excited just thinking about this, all it takes is a quick, 20 minute call with me or my team to see this system before your very eyes. My only caution is that if you want to use this system, you’ll probably make a lot of costly mistakes doing it on your own, but I’ll show you how to get around those when we talk.  
By the end of this call, you’ll know more about how to create predictable, passive income streams than you could learn from years of searching the internet. And I’ll show you the surprising reason this is true when we talk. 
So, before you leave this page, hurry and book your private sneak peek session right. I only do three of these sessions a week, and this week will book out fast. So fill in the form right now, book your FREE sneak peek session, and I’ll see you on the next page.

Booking Confirmating 
Call Confirmation Prompt:
Now create a page headline and script for a confirmation video for the people who accepted my Call Booking Offer and booked a call. 
Start this message by congratulating them on booking their call. Tell them that you and/or your team are excited about helping them achieve the PROMISE you made in your call booking offer message. Remind them that you also have a surprise waiting for them at the end of the video, and remind them of what this surprise will do for them.  
Next, urge them to listen to the entire video because you’re about to tell them how to make the most out of their time on the call. For extra effect, tell them that this is mandatory for getting their call, so neither of you waste your time, and that you’d hate to have to cancel their call because these things weren’t done.  
Next, give them the list of rules for their call. I suggest setting the following and making them non-negotiable: 
1.	They must be somewhere they can pay attention and take notes during the call. Never take a sales call from someone who is doing it while doing something else, like driving. These people are less likely to join your high-ticket program, or take you seriously when they do. 
2.	They confirm their call via SMS with someone who messages them immediately after the call booking, and again the night before. If they don’t confirm their call, there’s a good chance they won’t respect your time and show up. 
Next, use a “This is how we ensure that you…” to tie this list of rules to everything you promised in your main offer, your call booking offer, and any upsells they might have bought in between. It’s 100% essential that you sell them on what your call rules will do for THEM. None of this cutesy, “please be professional and respect our time…” or “We normally charge $___ for these calls…” blah, blah. I assure you, 99% of your prospects don’t give a rat’s hindquarters about what this call costs you. When negotiating any business transaction, always appeal to the other person’s self-interest rather than their sense of empathy, consideration, or moral duty. Those exceptions and too few and far between to base any marketing strategy on. 
Next, use a statement like “Now, I know what you’re thinking…” or “Now, if you're serious about [PROMISE], you probably have some questions…” to transition to the objections section of your video. 
Your objections section should address the most common objections that buyers have about your high-ticket offer. I’m including a list of the most common and universal here, then I’ll give you a basic formula for each one. 
1.	Timing Objections (“I’ll do it later…”)
2.	Third Party Objections (“I’ll need to talk to ___ before making a decision…”)
3.	Financial Objections (“This is too expensive…” OR “I don’t have the money…”)
4.	External Objections (“This might work for other people, but not for me because…”)
5.	Internal Objections (Objections about whether the high-ticket offer will deliver the promised result OR whether it will require additional things that they either can’t or don’t want to do)
6.	Commitment Objections (Objections about the time, energy, or effort required from them to get the result)
7.	Character Objections (Objections as to whether you really care about them, or are just trying to sell them something else)
Here’s the four step formula for overcoming these objections:
1.	State objection as your customer would
2.	Affirm and empathize with the objection 
3.	Offer a new perspective to reframe the objection
4.	Tie this new perspective to your offer promise
You can also use the “Feel, Felt, Found” formula (“You might feel [objection here], a lot of our customers FELT exactly the same way at first, but then they FOUND [something that overcomes the objection…]”) to reframe these objections. The order of these will depend on which of these objections are the most common for your type of SOLUTION. 
See the example below for demonstrations of how you’d overcome the first three objections, but make sure to write a response to ALL of the above objections when you create this video script. I’ve used numbered lists for the four steps to make them clearer.  
After reframing their objections, congratulate your customer again, and remind them that you and/or your team are excited about helping them achieve the PROMISE you made in your call booking offer message. 
Circle back to the surprise that you’ve been teasing them about in your upsell offer video, and earlier in this one. Tell them exactly what it is this time, and explain how it will help them solve their PROBLEM, and/or achieve the PROMISE of all your offers quicker, easier, or more dramatically. Give a dollar value for it, and tell them that they’re getting it FREE for attending the call. 
Finish by telling them they’ll get the final deliverable of the surprise (whether it’s a piece of information, a product, a service, or something else), when you see them on the call.

IMPORTANT: Watch This Video or Your Onboarding Call Will Be Canceled and Your Money Refunded!
Alright, congratulations, we’re ready to get your order started now. My team and I are super-excited to help you create an omnipresence and authority online so you can finally start attracting those five figure client deals you’ve been dreaming about.  
Now, please listen closely to EVERY second of this video, you’ve already taken your first step toward growing to seven figures by booking this call, and whether you succeed depends on what you do right now. 
First, to get the most value out of this call, you must do it in a place without interruptions, and where you can pay attention and TAKE NOTES. If one of my specialists sees that you’re not paying attention, or if you’re multitasking or trying to do this from your car, or while you’re at the airport, we WILL cancel your call and refund your money.
Secondly, one of my specialists will be reviewing your answers on the application you just filled out. If your application qualifies, you’ll get a confirmation email AND text message. Please respond to one of those and let us know that you’re serious about this call and ready to grow your business. 
Finally, I ask that you write three things down before we get on the call. Your primary business revenue goal for the next year, the biggest obstacle you’re facing right now, and how you hope we can help.  
These are ALL important steps if you want to create a stellar online presence and grow to seven figures by this time next year, so please make sure you do them, because I’d hate to hear that we had to cancel your call because you weren’t taking this seriously. 
Now, the fact that you’re still listening tells me you’re ready to break through to the next level in your business, but you probably have a few questions about how it works, so let’s cover those so we don’t waste our time on the call discussing the basics.
[Timing Objection] 
1.	First, you might be wondering whether you should just start with something small and simple, like the course you just bought. 
2.	I understand this, as you certainly don’t want to make an impulsive decision that you can’t follow through on later. 
3.	But, beware of the devils of perfectionism and procrastination, because they go hand in hand with poverty. Money likes speed, and the legendary author Napoleon Hill said that the most successful entrepreneurs are people who make decisions quickly, and are slow to back out and change their minds once they have. 
4.	That’s why we move fast when it comes to your onboarding calls with me and my team, getting your brand voice nailed down, and immediately creating and implementing a plan for making you an omnipresent authority online. 
[Third Party Objection]
1.	Second, you might be thinking that after getting on this call that you need to talk the decision over with someone else before moving forward. 
2.	I understand this, as you certainly want to make sure the key decision makers in your company are completely onboard so they aren’t objecting to everything you and my team are trying to do to scale your business this year. 
3.	But, if there are other decision makers in your business, they need to be on this call with you. This is non-negotiable, as we’ve had to cancel a few new customers this year, because there were other people in their business who either didn’t understand what we were doing, or had a different agenda. 
4.	That’s why we want every decision maker in your company on this call, even if you think you can relay the information to them yourself. This is how we make sure that our team can work with every key person in your business, so that you have the best chance for success. 
[Financial Objection]
1.	You might also be wondering whether there’s anything else you’ll need to buy or invest in to make this effort a success, and if so, how much you can expect to spend. 
2.	I understand this, and, like you, I hire a team to help my business with something and find out all they want to do is sell more services, before they’ve fulfilled the promise of the first thing they’ve sold me. 
3.	This is where we’re different, our job isn’t just to fulfill a service. Our monthly strategy calls take you behind the scenes where we show you the exact system we’re building together. We use objective data to troubleshoot your marketing strategy, and make sure you understand why we’re making the adjustments that we are. 
4.	By the time you’ve worked with us for six months, you’ll be empowered with a Master's degree level knowledge of what it takes to build, troubleshoot, and optimize an effective marketing system from the ground up. This will empower you to make better decisions when hiring, and managing contractors or employees to help with your marketing. I’m sure you’ll agree that this kind of knowledge is worth at least seven figures by itself, and even our highest level services are only a fraction of that. 
[Internal Objection]
1.	You might also be wondering whether you can get this result if you’ve blown a lot of money on investment training in the past, and haven’t followed through by applying what you learned. 
2.	I understand this, and, like you, I sometimes don’t follow through on the commitments I make to myself, so I can certainly understand the fear that this will just be one more thing that I started and didn’t finish. In fact, a lot of our clients have the exact same worry when they first decide to join one of our coaching programs.
3.	What they ALL find is that the support, accountability, and encouragement of being a part of our close knit network of like-minded new investors makes it much, much easier to not only apply what they know, but to form the priceless habit of taking action on new ideas. 
4.	By the time you’ve been a part of this community for just a few weeks, you’ll wonder why you ever worried about not following through. You’ll become dependable, and develop a new level of trust and self-assurance that will dramatically improve your confidence, and earn the respect of everyone around you. 
[External Objection]
1.	You might also be asking whether working with one of our coaches will mean extra homework, meetings, and other stuff that will distract you from using the materials you’ve already purchased from us. 
2.	I understand this, and, like you, I find it frustrating when getting expert help just makes me feel like I’m back in college again. In fact, I even blew ten thousand dollars once on a mentorship program that I had to quit halfway through because it became a burden instead of a help. 
3.	But what ALL our clients in this program find is that working with one of our coaches is actually the faster, more convenient way to speed up their results, and skip what would have been weeks, months, or even years of trying to apply these strategies on their own. 
4.	By the time you’re off this call, you’ll be thanking yourself for going above and beyond, and putting yourself in the small, elite group of entrepreneurs who decided that they’d rather get faster results by working with someone who has helped hundreds of people succeed with this system. 
[Commitment Objection]
1.	You might also be asking whether you want the hassle of having someone checking in on you, and having to keep up with taking action every week, especially when you’re busy trying to run your business. 
2.	We understand this, and, like you, many of our coaches left other companies to work with us because they wanted a simple, actionable coaching framework that would help them get fast, practical results, using a system that only required them to give 15 minutes a day to learn and apply. 
3.	This is the exact type of system we use to coach our elite level clients, and you’ll see exactly what we mean after your first few weeks in this coaching program. In fact, our system is so turnkey and user friendly, you’ll wish every part of running your business could be this simple.
4.	By the time you’re finished with our coaching program, you’ll feel like you’ve made literally years of progress in just a few short weeks, and you’ll have skills that will pay for themselves over and over for the rest of your life by empowering you to attract more customers into ANY business you start. 
[Character Objection]
1.	Finally, you might be asking whether we really want to help accelerate your results, or if this is just another one of those bait and switch sales calls where we’ll ask you to give us more money to solve the problem you thought you’d solved by buying what you just bought. 
2.	I understand this. Like you, I hate talking to salespeople, and especially hate that “you have to buy the next thing…” tactic that always seems to repeat itself with each new upgrade, luring you into an endless parade of expensive purchases that fail to deliver what the original offer promised to deliver. 
3.	What EVERYONE who takes this call discovers is that we don’t need people in our coaching program, and often turn people down who want to sign up, because we just don’t feel like it was the smart move for them at this time. 
4.	We have plenty of new people interested in our coaching program, and it makes no difference whether you sign up or not. But, if it is a good fit, it will make a world of difference for you by saving you the hours you would have spent learning this on your own AND helping you get the result you want faster, and with less effort.  
So, that’s it. I hope that answers your questions. Again, congratulations for making it this far. My team and I are super excited about working with you to make this your BEST YEAR EVER in business. 
Lastly, yes, I know you’re dying to know what this mysterious surprise is that I told you about on the previous page. I’m in the process of creating a series of high-level, AI prompts that can create literally ALL the content you need for attracting clients, turning them into customers, and getting them to buy from you again, and again, at premium prices. 
These prompts are so precise, and so powerful, they’ll literally save you at least $100k this year that you would have spent hiring content writers. Better yet, all the content will be in your unique voice, and infused with your best ideas and insights, so that people will see YOU as the most omnipresent, one-of-a-kind authority in your niche. 
You’ll get this entire AI Prompt library on your call with my team, and we’ll even show you how to use it to start multiplying your influence and authority online, as early as this weekend, even if you only have 90 minutes to use them. So congratulations again for getting booked in, I hope you’re ready to make this your best year in business, and I’ll see you on our call.
