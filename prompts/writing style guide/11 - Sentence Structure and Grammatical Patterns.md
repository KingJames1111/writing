## 11. Sentence Structure and Grammatical Patterns
Construct sentences that are clear and direct, prioritizing the "Subject – Transitive Verb – Object" structure. Use active voice to engage readers and make your writing more dynamic. Eliminate redundancy and unnecessary words. Vary sentence length and complexity to maintain rhythm and interest. Strong, descriptive verbs can replace weaker forms to add vigor to your prose.

**Examples:**
- **Good Example:** "The dog chased the ball."
- **Poor Example:** "The ball was chased by the dog."
- **Varying Sentence Length:** "She gazed at the stars. Infinite possibilities stretched before her, each one a distant beacon calling her name."
