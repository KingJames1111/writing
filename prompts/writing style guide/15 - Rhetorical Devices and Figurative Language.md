## 15. Rhetorical Devices and Figurative Language
Use rhetorical devices to add depth and persuasion to your writing. Metaphors, analogies, and personification can make complex ideas more accessible and memorable. Employ these devices tastefully and ensure they serve to enhance understanding rather than distract.

**Examples:**
- **Metaphor:** "Time is a thief that steals moments."
- **Analogy:** "Managing a team is like conducting an orchestra; every member must be in harmony."
- **Personification:** "The wind whispered secrets through the trees."
