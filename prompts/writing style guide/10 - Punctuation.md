## 10. Punctuation
Punctuation guides the reader through your writing, adding clarity and nuance. Use commas to separate clauses and enhance readability. Employ dashes for emphasis or to insert additional thoughts. Colons can introduce lists or explanations, while semicolons link closely related ideas. Use apostrophes correctly for contractions and possessives. Quotation marks denote direct speech or specific terms.

**Examples:**
- **Commas:** "Before the sun rose, she had already started her journey."
- **Dashes:** "He knew one thing for certainâ€”nothing would ever be the same."
- **Colons:** "Remember to pack the essentials: toothbrush, passport, and tickets."
- **Semicolons:** "She loved the city; it was alive with energy."
- **Apostrophes:** "It's a beautiful day for a walk."
- **Quotation Marks:** "The term 'global village' refers to the world's interconnectedness."
