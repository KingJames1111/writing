## 12. Paragraph Structure and Coherence
Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea. Ensure that each sentence flows logically to the next, maintaining coherence. Use transitional phrases to guide the reader through your arguments or narratives. Keep paragraphs focused on a single idea, and vary their length to enhance readability.

**Examples:**
- **Topic Sentence:** "Effective communication is essential in leadership."
- **Flow and Coherence:** "Listening actively fosters trust. Trust, in turn, builds strong teams capable of achieving great things."
