## 4. Authenticity
Authentic writing resonates with readers by being genuine and relatable. Use conversational language and eliminate jargon or overly formal phrases that can create distance between you and your audience. Avoid clichés unless they serve a purpose like irony or sarcasm. Write as if you're speaking directly to the reader, fostering a connection through sincerity.

**Examples:**
- **Good Example:** "You might find this approach helpful."
- **Poor Example:** "One might find this methodology advantageous."
- **Good Example:** "It's raining cats and dogs!" (Used humorously)
- **Poor Example:** Overused clichés without purpose.
