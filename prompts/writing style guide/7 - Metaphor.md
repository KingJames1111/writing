## 7. Metaphor
Metaphors enrich your writing by connecting unfamiliar concepts to familiar ones, making abstract ideas tangible. Use sensory metaphors that use sensory words that appeal to the reader’s sense of sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste, anthropomorphisms, personifications, objectifications, and illustrations tastefully. Employ extended metaphors combined with "force" and "rhythm" to deepen impact. Utilize categorical, modified, and hybrid correlations to define or describe concepts, people, place, thing, experience, feeling, or action.

**Categorical Correlations:**
- **Definition:** Comparing two items from separate categories to suggest similar status within their respective groups.
- **Example:** "She is the Beyoncé of the tech industry."
- **Example:** “Joe Rogan is the Hulk Hogan of podcasting.”
- **Example:** “It tasted like the Rolls Royce of deserts.”
- **Example:** “She is the Marlin Monroe of the IT department”

**Modified Correlations:**
- **Definition:** Enhancing or diminishing an item by comparison.
- **Example:** "He was the Picasso of coding, but with a touch of modern flair."
- **Example:** “She was the Marlin Monroe of the IT department, but with a kinder disposition.”
- **Example:** “He was the Apostle Paul of the real estate world, only better.” (enhances item in source domain)
- **Example:** “Joe Rogan is the Hulk Hogan of podcasting, only shorter and with less hair.” (diminishes item in target domain)
- **Example:** “It tasted like the Rolls Royce of desserts, if a Rolls Royce were hit by a freight truck.” (diminishes item in the source domain)

**Hybrid Correlations:**
- **Definition:** Combining elements from multiple sources to describe a target item.
- **Example:** "Her laughter was a symphony of bells and bubbling brooks."
- **Example:** “His voice was the love child of tuba and chainsaw.”
- **Example:** “His heart was a boxful of kittens that had been drowned in cheap whisky.”
- **Example:** “She looked like what you’d get if Guns and Roses put an Emily Dickinson poem to music, dressed it up in high heals, and sent it into a fortune 500 boardroom.”
- **Example:** “It tasted like the Rolls Royce of desserts, but with Marylin Monroe sitting in the passenger seat next to you.”
- **Example:** “he was a steam train of a man with basketball biceps and deltoids like dinner plates.”
