## 2. Brevity
Brevity is about expressing your thoughts using as few words as necessary without sacrificing clarity. Eliminate redundant words and phrases, and opt for strong, descriptive verbs over weak ones in place of phrases that start with words like: “is,” “was,” “were,” “will be,” etc. Avoid using unnecessary nouns when the meaning is already implied (e.g., “sales event,” “crisis situation,” “gambling activities,” etc.  By being concise, you respect your reader's time and keep them engaged.

**Examples:**
- **Good Example:** "He reconsidered his decision."
- **Poor Example:** "He thought about his decision again."
- **Good Example:** "She smiled."
- **Poor Example:** "She had a smile on her face."
