To evoke emotions and create vivid images in your reader's mind, use sensory details that appeal to sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. Describe things in concrete terms rather than abstract concepts. Sensory words and metaphors help establish themes, set moods, and reveal character traits. Use "noun-verb" combinations to both describe something and explain how it came to be.

**Examples:**
- **Good Example:** "The freshly baked bread filled the room with a warm, comforting aroma."
- **Poor Example:** "The bread smelled good."
- **Noun-Verb Combination:** "The time-worn book whispered stories of ancient adventures."
