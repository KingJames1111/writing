## 1. Force
To infuse your writing with energy, focus on constructing sentences in the "Subject – Transitive Verb – Object" format. This structure places the action at the forefront, making your sentences more dynamic and engaging. Use active voice instead of passive voice to make your statements more direct and powerful. Avoid hedging words like "rather," "somewhat," "generally," ‘virtually”, “pretty”, “slightly”, “a little”, and "a bit," which can weaken your assertions. Instead, state things affirmatively unless a contrasting negation is necessary for emphasis or clarity.

**Examples:**
- **Good Example:** "The ring sparkled under the moonlight."
- **Poor Example:** "The ring was shiny under the moonlight."
- **Good Example:** "She delivered the presentation with confidence."
- **Poor Example:** "The presentation was delivered with confidence by her."
